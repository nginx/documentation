# F5 NGINX Documentation style guide

{Version number and last updated date}

## Introduction

Welcome to our project! This style guide is intended for use by project
contributors, not necessarily end-users. It provides general guidance to anyone
who contributes to the project's documentation.

## Intended audience and scope

This style guide is intended for use by any contributors that are writing
documentation for F5 NGINX products, including software engineers. This guide
can help project contributors to communicate clearly and consistently in the project's end-user documentation, API documentation, configuration files, and in-product user messages.

## Our preferred style guide

This document contains guidelines specific to the the documentation of F5 NGINX products and open source projects. 

F5 NGINX follows the [Microsoft style guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
for user-facing content and the Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).


Our project uses standard American spelling and our preferred dictionary is the
[American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/) or your preferred
dictionary.

When writing documentation for our project, align with the default guide's
voice and tone.

## F5 brand trademarks and product names

- Always use the full brand name the first time it occurs in written copy. For example:
    
  - F5 NGINX Plus 
  - F5 NGINX App Protect WAF
  - F5 NGINX Management Suite

- After the first use, you can drop the "F5". All subsequent uses must include the "NGINX" brand name. For example:

  - NGINX Plus
  - NGINX App Protect WAF
  - NGINX Management Suite
    
- Always use the full brand name in the meta description.
- Never use acronyms instead of the full product names.     
- We don’t need to use trademarks in product documentation.

## Glossary of preferred terms

The table provides guidelines about the terms you should and should not use for
consistency, listed in alphabetical order:

| abbreviations: acronyms and initialisms, capitalization                                                 | Acronyms and initialisms are abbreviations that are written out in capitalized letters, but unless the word or phrase they represent is a proper noun, the words do not need to be capitalized. For example single sign-on (SSO). Note: acronyms are pronounced as words (such as LAN) but initialisms are pronounced as letters (such as SSO).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| autoscaling terms: scale up or scale down scale out or scale in                                         | Provide context to ensure clarity. To scale horizontally (or scale out/in) means to add more nodes to (or remove nodes from) a system. To scale vertically (or scale up/down) means to add resources to (or remove resources from) a single node in a system, typically involving the addition of CPUs or memory to a single computer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| boot, boot up, reboot                                                                                   | Use start and restart if possible.  For boot, use in the context of boot to a new volume, but if the meaning is start, then use start. Do not use boot up. For reboot, use restart even in the cases of code or UI elements that say Reboot. For example, in the VELOS UI, the button is Reboot. So you would write, to restart, select Reboot.  If in doubt, ask your editor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Use Warning as the severest form of advisory, reserved for when there's a hazard to personnel (such as you're being directed to install a server rack and there's a chance it may fall on you).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

When a user populates multiple settings for an entire feature, the user is configuring that feature. For example: Use the Configuration utility (or command line) to configure the appliance. Configuration tasks are multi-step procedures that result in some particular system configuration. As the user configures many features, the user is creating the configuration for the system itself. If the user is simply specifying a value, such as a value for the login URL setting, then that user is not configuring it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Why do I care? What are the benefits to me? Do not use as directive statements. Do: You create a virtual server that uses XXX with an XXX profile to classify and accelerate traffic for applications that are running on the virtual server. Do not: “o create custom XXX to use for securing XX, follow these steps.  Do not: Create custom XXX to use for securing XX, follow these steps. Note: You do not need to begin the context statements with You can or In order to. The idea is to answer the question posted by the topic title and task. How you construct that sentence is up to you. Keep it concise and keep the conceptual information in the concept topics. Use a declarative sentence. Do not use imperative voice, however, since that is reserved for step content.

Practice best judgment when employing them. In some instances, a hyphen may seem unnecessary as the compound word may be clear enough to the user and frequently presented without a hyphen, such as antivirus. In other cases, a term may look odd without it, so you may choose to include it for readability, such as pre-entrancy vs. preentrancy.

They break the builds so cannot be included. Also, apply appropriate tags to identify what the text represents (such as a log or error message, and so on) rather than using quotes to add emphasis or convey something about the text origin. You can use smart (straight) quotes in release notes that are in TBA topic form, for table cell content (such as CLI syntax and related text in Known issues, and so on).

Task summary (lowercase summary) is correct; do not use Initial Cap style. MORE INFO: A standalone Task summary topic is not needed unless there are prerequisites to the overall implementation; in that case, some text describing the tasks is appropriate. Ideally, we would not use standalone Task summary topics when there are no prereqs. If Task summary is merely a section heading and in an Overview topic, then there does not need to be any text in the topic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

(that you configuredis essential to distinguish them from virtual servers that you did not yet configure.) The virtual servers, which you configured, are ready. (which you formatted is not essential because you do not have any configured ones to distinguish the configured ones from. This is just extra, non-essential, information. Note: which and the clause it modifies are set off by commas because you could eliminate the clause without changing the meaning of the sentence.

Do not use the word version between the software name and the version (for example, BIG-IP version 13.x) When indicating a range of versions in procedure titles or subsection titles, indicate the software name and then the version range with a space, hyphen, and space between the version numbers (for example BIG-IP 12.x - 13.x) In article titles, when the software version or version range is indicated in parenthesis at the end of the line, omit the software name; for version ranges, use the space, hyphen, and space between the version numbers. For example, Setting up a virtual server (12.x) and Setting up a virtual server (10.x - 11.x) In paragraph form, use from and through to describe inclusive ranges.

However, if your situation requires you to use one of these, use the following guidance: Caution is less severe than Warning. Use Caution when alerting that damage may occur, such as data loss. Use Warning as the severest form of advisory, reserved for when there's a hazard to personnel (such as you're being directed to install a server rack and there's a chance it may fall on you).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Term  | Recommendations  |  Explanation
--------------- | -----------------  |  -----------
abort | Never use this term in your docs. Use the preferred terms when writing about a process:<br>stop<br>interrupt<br>shut down| Abort is acceptable to use in programmer or similar technical documentation only if it is a function name, parameter name, or otherwise part of a name in the API. 
above and below	| Avoid. Refer to the specific section, table, figure, an so on, as opposed to indicating its relative position in the document.
access	| Used as a verb, it’s jargon, so don’t use it.|
allows	| Not recommended. \<br>Avoid phrases such as "NGINX Plus allows you to…". \<br><br>Use direct, active verbs from the perspective of the user instead. |
and/or	| Not recommended. Usually, this means either "and" or "or". Try to be specific in your writing; people are counting on you for clear instructions. |  |
anthropomorphism | Avoid referring to the product or feature as though it were alive. \<br>When referring to products, stay away from words like: decides, knows, sees, listens, and hears.<br>A wizard guides you, it doesn’t walk you through the steps.
application	| When referring to applications in general, write out the entire word. For clarity, avoid abbreviating to "app" unless specifically referencing the user interface or product.
as/because | Use "because" instead of "as" when showing a cause and effect relationship. | |
attack signature, attack signature set | Refers to elements of the NGINX App Protect WAF package. Do not abbreviate or otherwise shorten. | |
backwards | Use backward and forward, not backwards and forwards | |
black list<br> blacklist<br> blacklisted | Do not use these terms.<br>Use these terms instead:<br>-black list (noun) = deny list (noun)<br>-blacklist (verb) = denylist (verb)<br>-blacklisted (adjective) = denylisted (adjective)
boot, boot up, reboot | Use "start" and "restart" if possible.<br>For "boot", use in the context of "boot to a new volume". If the meaning is actually "start", then use "start". Do not use "boot up".<br>Instead of "reboot", use "restart". \<br>When referring to applying configuration changes, use "reload".
case insensitive | Use "not case-sensitive" instead of "case insensitive". | |
caution/warning	| Caution is less severe than Warning. Use Caution when alerting that damage may occur, such as down time or service interruption. Use Warning as the severest form of advisory, such as the risk of data loss or sustained outage.| |
certificate authority (CA) | | |
certificate request | | |
certificate signing request (CSR) | |

client certificate authentication | |
Client SSL | |
client-side or client side | Hyphenate when used as adjective. | |
colloquial language	| Try to avoid using colloquial language, which does not translate well. For example, use "press Esc", not "hit Esc"; "Go to the next section", not "jump to the next section". | |
colon | Never use a colon to introduce a graphic, a figure, or a table. | |
comma (serial or Oxford) | **Always use the serial (Oxford) comma.**<br><br>Example: "apples, oranges, and bananas"; not "apples, oranges and bananas".| |
comma-separated | Always hyphenate. For example: a comma-separated values (CSV) file | |
command line and command prompt (usage)	| Use "command line".<br><br>NOUN: …at the command line.<br>ADJ: …using command-line tools.<br>At the command prompt, type...<br>Do not use command-line prompt.| |
configure | Do not use except when describing the configuration of an NGINX product, such as when installing NGINX or NGINX Agent.<br>In most cases, use "set up" instead.| |
contractions | Contractions are okay to use as long as they're not ambiguous. | |
Cookie persistence (option type) | |

data center | Write this as two words. | |
em dash | Allowed in the proper context. May be written using two dashes to ensure it converts correctly when displayed in the web version. | |
data source | |
database | Do not abbreviate as "db". Always a single word. | |
DoS/DDoS/3DoS | Spell out on first reference:<br>- denial-of-service (DoS)<br>- distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)<br>- diverse distributed denial-of-service (3DoS) \<insert nick-shadrin-facepalm emoji here> | |
e.g., i.e., etc.| Avoid using Latin abbreviations.<br>- e.g. = for example<br>- i.e. = in other words<br>- etc. = and so on | |
earlier and later | Use to describe versioning. For example, "This applies to versions earlier than NGINX Plus R31".<br>Do not use before, after, greater, lower, higher, below, above, and so on. | | 
either/or | Not recommended.<br>Usually, we mean either, or we mean or. Try to be specific in your writing; people are counting on you for specific instructions. It's okay to use these terms when separated by text, as in, "You can use either the semi-colon or the comma here".| |

- [Write the Docs - Style Guides](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/style-guides/#writing-style)
- [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/)

## Accessible writing

Documentation should be written in a way that supports people with disabilities
and users with various input methods and devices. Improving accessibility also
helps make documentation clearer and more useful for everyone.

For resources on making your writing more accessible, see:

- [Writing accessible documentation - Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility)
- [Accessibility guidelines and requirements - Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/accessibility/accessibility-guidelines-requirements)
- [Writing for Accessibility - Mailchimp Content Style Guide](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/writing-for-accessibility/)

## Inclusive and bias-free writing

When contributing to this project, you should strive to write documentation with
inclusivity and diversity in mind. Inclusive language recognizes diversity and
strives to communicate respectfully to all people. This kind of language is
sensitive to differences and seeks to promote equal opportunities.
