## Background

The history of coffee dates back to the 15th century, and possibly earlier with a number of reports and legends surrounding its first use. The native origin of coffee is thought to have been Ethiopia, with several mythical accounts but no solid evidence. The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree is from the early 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen, spreading soon to Mecca and Cairo. 

By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, South India, Persia, Turkey, the Horn of Africa, and northern Africa. Coffee then spread to the Balkans, Italy, and to the rest of Europe, to Indonesia, and then to America. 

The word "coffee" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch "koffie", borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish "kahve", in turn borrowed from the Arabic "qahwah". The Arabic word qahwah originally referred to a type of wine, whose etymology is given by Arab lexicographers as deriving from the verb qahā, signifying "to lack hunger", used in reference to the drink's reputation as an appetite suppressant.

The popularity of coffee and the rise of coffeehouses have influenced several social aspects in our society including politics, culture, and economics.
