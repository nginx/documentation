## Background

The history of coffee dates back to the 15th century, and possibly earlier with a number of reports and legends surrounding its first use. The native origin of coffee is thought to have been Ethiopia, with several mythical accounts but no solid evidence. The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree is from the early 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen, spreading soon to Mecca and Cairo.
