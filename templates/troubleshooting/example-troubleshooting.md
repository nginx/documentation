# Issues with your coffee

This guide describes some common issues that can happen when preparing coffee, and how to fix them.

## Weak coffee

The prepared coffee doesn't have a strong smell or taste of caffiene, or doesn't affect you as much as expected.

### Incorrect amount of beans

The most common symptom of a weak coffee is an incorrect amount of beans or powder.

**Solution**

The common baseline amount of coffee for a single serving is 15 grams.

The best way to measure this amount is by weighting it in powder form, just before it is brewed.

## Wrong taste

The prepared coffee tastes wrong, and lacking in many expected flavors.

### Expired beans

The most common symptom of wrong taste for a coffee is expired beans.

**Solution**

Coffee beans are best used within a month of opening a bag, while ground coffee is typically good for a week.

Both are dependent on being stored properly: in a dry, airtight environment at room temperature.

## Odd texture

The prepared coffee has an odd texture, possibly with small lumps in the liquid.

### Dirty equipment

Odd textures are typically caused by improperly maintained equipment.

**Solution**

Make sure that the brewing equipment and serving cups are cleaned between uses.

Depending on your brewing method, you will also need to replace or wash the filter regularly.
