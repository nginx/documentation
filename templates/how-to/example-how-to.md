# Grind Coffee

## Overview

This guide explains how to grind coffee beans to achieve the best flavour and consistency for your coffee.

## Before you begin

Before you begin grinding your coffee beans ensure:

- You have fresh, high-quality coffee beans.
- A coffee grinder is available, either burr or blade.
- You understand the different grind sizes needed for various brewing methods.

## Grinding coffee

Grinding coffee is essential to maximize the flavour extraction from coffee beans. The grind size needed varies based on the brewing method used.

1. **Choose the right grinder:** Select a burr grinder for a more consistent grind or a blade grinder if availability is limited.
2. **Select the appropriate grind size:** Determine the grind size based on your brewing method.
    1. **Coarse grind** for french press or percolators.
    2. **Medium grind** for drip or filter coffee makers.
    3. **Fine grind** for espresso machines
3. **Measure your coffee beans:** Use a scale to measure your coffee beans before grinding. A general rule of thumb is 60g of coffee per 1000g of water, depending on your preferred strength.
4. **Grind your coffee:** Place the beans in your grind and grind them to your desired consistency based on the chosen grind size.
5. **Brew immediately:** Brew your freshly ground coffee immediately for the best flavour.

### Adjusting your grind
If you find your coffee too weak or too strong, you might need to adjust the grind size:

- A finer grind can increase extraction, leading to a stronger brew.
- A coarser grind decreases extraction, making the coffee weaker.

### Espresso grind size
Espresso grind size is especially difficult to fine tune. See [How To Dial in Espresso](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxz0FjZMVOl3ksLTyWsWNFdU1b73w1BUW) for a complete how-to.
