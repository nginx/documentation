Install the Controller Agent on each NGINX Plus instance that you want to manage and monitor. Also, after you upgrade NGINX Controller, you should update the Controller Agent to the latest version.

For instructions on how to install, update, and configure the Controller Agent, see the the [Controller Agent Installation Guide]({{< relref "admin-guides/install/install-nginx-controller-agent.md" >}}).
