The App Security Add-on for NGINX Controller ADC lets you protect your applications with a web applications firewall (WAF). The WAF protects your apps from a variety of application layer attacks such as [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://www.f5.com/services/resources/glossary/cross-site-scripting-xss-or-css), [SQL injection](https://www.f5.com/services/resources/glossary/sql-injection), and [cookie poisoning](https://www.f5.com/services/resources/glossary/cookie-poisoning), among others.

A WAF protects your web apps by filtering, monitoring, and blocking any malicious HTTP/S traffic traveling to the web application, and prevents any unauthorized data from leaving the app. It does this by adhering to a set of policies that help determine what traffic is malicious and what traffic is safe. Just as a proxy server acts as an intermediary to protect the identity of a client, a WAF operates in similar fashion but in the reverse—called a reverse proxy—acting as an intermediary that protects the web app server from a potentially malicious client.
