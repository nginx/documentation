The Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) should be a proper domain. The FQDN is used by Controller Agents to access NGINX Controller. It's also used to access the web interface.

Updating the FQDN for NGINX Controller is a two-step process:

1. Update the FQDN for NGINX Controller using the web interface or the REST API.
1. Update the Controller Agents to use the new FQDN.
