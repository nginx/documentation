Install NGINX App Protect on a host accessible by your NGINX Controller instance by following the appropriate steps for your operating system in the [Using NGINX App Protect with NGINX Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-app-protect/admin-guide/install-for-controller/) guide.

{{< note >}}
If you install NGINX App Protect by using any of the OS-specific install guides, **do not make changes to the `nginx.conf` file**.  
The NGINX Controller Agent manages `nginx.conf` settings and will make the appropriate adjustments for you.
