You can use the Controller user interface to configure some of the Controller Agent settings. On the Agent page, you can enable or disable account-wide behavior for:

* NGINX configuration files analysis
* Periodic NGINX configuration syntax checking with `nginx -t`
* Analyzing SSL certs

Per-system settings are accessible from the **Settings** icon that can be found for a particular NGINX on the **Analyzer** page. Per-system settings override the global settings. If you prefer to monitor your NGINX configurations on all but some specific systems, you can deselect the corresponding settings.
