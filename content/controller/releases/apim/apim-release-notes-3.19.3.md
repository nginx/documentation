## Upgrade Considerations

Take note of the following considerations when upgrading to this version of the NGINX Controller API Management Module:

- After upgrading NGINX Controller, make sure to upgrade the NGINX Controller Agent too.

- If you're upgrading NGINX Controller on a multi-node cluster, run the `update.sh` script on each node individually -- the order in which you update the nodes doesn't matter.

  {{< warning >}}Never update the control nodes in parallel. Doing so may result in race conditions for certain jobs, such as database migrations, and may cause the cluster to become unavailable.{{< /warning >}}

This release fixes the following issues. To view the history for an issue, search the NGINX Docs website for the issue ID.
