## 4.0.0

16 Dec 2024

With added support for [NGINX R33]({{< ref "/nginx/releases.md#nginxplusrelease-33-r33" >}}), deployments of F5 NGINX Ingress Controller using NGINX Plus now require a valid JSON Web Token to run.
For full details on setting up your license `Secret`, see [Upgrading to v4]({{< ref "/nic/install/upgrade.md#upgrade-from-3x-to-4x" >}}).

API Version `v1alpha1` of `GlobalConfiguration`, `Policy` and `TransportServer` resources are now deprecated.
For full details on updating your resources, see [Update custom resource apiVersion]({{< ref "/nic/install/upgrade.md#upgrade-from-3x-to-4x" >}}).

Updates have been made to our logging library. For a while, F5 NGINX Ingress Controller has been using the [golang/glog](https://github.com/golang/glog). For this release, we have moved to the native golang library [log/slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog).
This change was made for these reasons:

1. By using a standard library, we ensure that updates are more consistent, and any known vulnerabilities are more likely to be addressed in a timely manner.
1. By moving to `log/slog`, we enable support for a wider range of logging formats, as well as allowing log outputs to be displayed in a Structured format, and for faster log parsing.

Layer 4 applications got some love this release, with added support for SNI based routing with our TransportServer resource!
In scenarios where you have multiple applications hosted on a single node, this feature enables routing to those applications through the host header.
For more details on what this feature does, and how to configure it yourself, please look to our [examples section in Github](https://github.com/nginx/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v4.0.0/examples/custom-resources/transport-server-sni#transportserver-sni)

## 3.7.2

25 Nov 2024

{{< call-out "note" >}}
In our next major release, `v4.0.0`, the default log library for NGINX Ingress Controller will be changed from `golang/glog` to `log/slog`.
This will mean that logs generated by NGINX Ingress Controller will be in a structured format with the option to choose a `string` or `json` output.
This will not affect logs generated by NGINX.
To ensure backwards compatibility, we will ensure the existing log format, `glog`, will be maintained through a configuration option for the next 3 releases.
{{< /call-out >}}

{{< call-out "important" >}}
CRD version removal notice.
In our next major release, `v4.0.0`, support for the following apiVersions for these listed CRDs will be dropped:

1. `k8s.nginx.org/v1alpha` for `GlobalConfiguration`
1. `k8s.nginx.org/v1alpha` for `Policy`
1. `k8s.nginx.org/v1alpha` for `TransportServer`

Prior to upgrading, **please ensure** that any of these resources deployed as `apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1alpha1` are upgraded to `apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1`
If a resource of `kind: GlobalConfiguration`, `kind: Policy` or `kind: TransportServer` are deployed as `apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1alpha1`, these resources will be **deleted** when upgrading from, at least, `v3.4.0` to `v4.0.0`

When `v4.0.0` is released, the release notes will contain the required upgrade steps to go from `v3.X.X` to `v4.X.X`

## 3.7.0

30 Sept 2024

Added support for VirtualServer & TransportServer to listen on a specific IP when configuring a listener, allowing NGINX to bind to a specific interface. This is also useful in for scenarios where pods need to connect to multiple networks i.e. multi-homed.
Allow an End Session Endpoint to be configured for OIDC providers via Policy. This allows a user to be fully logged out from their idp session. This change also adds support for configuring a post-logout redirect URI, allowing a users to be redirected to a custom logout page.

The `access_log` directive can now be configured to point to a syslog log server. Previously, access logs defaulted to standard out. This change allows for log parsers aggregators to ingest access logs from NGINX.

When installing NGINX Ingress Controller via Helm, a uniquely named lease object will be created automatically. This allows for multiple deployments of NGINX Ingress Controller in the same namespace when leader election is enabled, without requiring a unique name to be specified manually for each deployment.

## 3.6.0

25 Jun 2024

Added support for the latest generation of NGINX App Protect Web Application Firewall, v5. NGINX Ingress Controller will continue to support the NGINX App Protect v4 family to allow customers to implement new Policy Bundle workflow at their own pace.
F5 WAF for NGINX v5 does not accept the JSON based policies, instead requiring users to compile a Policy Bundle outside of the NGINX Ingress Controller pod. Policy bundles contain a combination of custom Policy, signatures, and campaigns. Bundles can be compiled using either the F5 WAF for NGINX [compiler]({{< ref "/waf/configure/compiler.md" >}}), or [NGINX Instance Manager]({{< ref "/nim/waf-integration/policies-and-logs/bundles/list-bundles.md" >}}). Read more in the [F5 WAF for NGINX V5]({{< ref "/nic/integrations/app-protect-waf-v5/" >}})  topic.

With this release, NGINX Ingress Controller is implementing a new image maintenance policy. Container images for subscribed users will be updated on a regular basis in-between releases to reduce the CVE vulnerabilities.
Customers can observe the 3.6.x tag when listing images in the registry and select the latest image to update to for the current release.

## 3.5.0

26 Mar 2024

NGINX Ingress Controller and F5 WAF for NGINX users can can now view violations through NGINX Instance Manager Security Monitor.  Security Monitor can be used to build Policy bundles, reducing reload time impacts on NGINX Ingress Controller.  Read more information in [F5 WAF for NGINX Bundles]({{< ref "/nic/integrations/app-protect-waf/configuration.md#waf-bundles" >}}) and Security Monitoring.

When using NGINX Plus for two version [split rollouts]({{ ref "/nic/configuration/virtualserver-and-virtualserverroute-resources.md#split" }}), you can now control progressive rollouts of a new backend version without reloading NGINX using the [**-weight-changes-dynamic-reload**]({{< ref "/nic/configuration/global-configuration/command-line-arguments.md#-weight-changes-dynamic-reload" >}}) command line argument.

The [**use-cluster-ip**]({{< ref "/nic/configuration/ingress-resources/advanced-configuration-with-annotations.md#backend-services-upstreams" >}}) annotation is now available for the Ingress resource.
**use-cluster-ip** supports service meshes and specific use cases where the backend service should be the target instead of individual backend service pods, bypassing upstream load balancing.
