### Resolved Issues

- 9065 Fixed - Increasing the limit for "max_request_size" in log configuration from 2k to 10k. The default will change from "any" to 2k to maintain the old behaviour.
- 9297 Fixed - Add new limit from `responseCheckLength` to response ingress event handling in order to reduce the memory used for buffering.

### Limitation

- 9992 - There is a limitation on Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) protocol on CentOS 7 as the Enforcer does not support this protocol on this Operating System (OS). When a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with EdDSA is used on CentOS 7, it results in a `VIOL_ACCESS_INVALID` error.

### **Important Notes**

- Starting with this release, the bot signatures list is generated automatically as a part of the **app-protect-bot-signatures** package, which is a dependency of the **app-protect-compiler** package. It resembles a format similar to the README-style text file found in the attack signature.
Refer to the [Bot Signatures Update File]({{< relref "/nap-waf/v4/configuration-guide/configuration.md#bot-signatures-update-file" >}}) for more details.

- Starting with the next release version of NGINX App Protect WAF, the existing bot signatures file `included_bot_signatures` which is located at the following path: `/opt/app-protect/var/update_files/included_bot_signatures` will be removed from the **app-protect-compile** package.
