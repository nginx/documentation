### Important Notes

This version introduces the removal of the `bd_agent` process. This process is no longer required starting with NGINX App Protect WAF version 3.5.
The removal of `bd_agent` reduces the memory usage of NGINX App Protect WAF by ~100 MB.
The `bd_agent` executable is still available on the system, but will not consume any CPU resources if it is run. Existing orchestration systems that include this process will continue to work as expected.
