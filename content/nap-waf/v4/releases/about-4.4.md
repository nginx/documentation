### Resolved Issues

- 8302 Fixed - Remote logging destinations when IPv6 is disabled system-wide.
- 7819 Fixed - The login issue encountered on the iOS client when using the AJAX Response Page has been resolved. This problem specifically occurs on iOS devices when NGINX's `proxy_buffering` is disabled.
- 8261 Fixed - Binaries have been upgraded with module and version updates to address and resolve identified vulnerabilities.
- 8477 Fixed - TCP connections in the CLOSE_WAIT state for specific types of requests.

### **Important Notes**

- There is a limitation when using [Override Rules]({{< relref "/nap-waf/v4/configuration-guide/configuration.md#override-rules" >}}) with gRPC. The Override Rules do not provide support for gRPC traffic. If the Override Rules are configured to match gRPC traffic, it will result in the blocking of such traffic.

- Starting with the upcoming release version of NGINX Plus R30, Ubuntu 18.04 will no longer be supported and will be deprecated.
