### Known Issues

#### 1341 - Syslog Clock

The time stamps in the NGINX and NGINX App Protect WAF log messages are presented in the local time zone of your machine. If you would like to see this in a different time zone, for example UTC, you must change the local time zone. On most systems this can be done using the command:

```shell
sudo datetimectl set-timezone Etc/UTC
```

For other options to change the timezone see your system manual.

#### General - `proxy_pass` buffering

The `proxy_pass` directive must always be used.
`proxy_request_buffering off` is not supported.
