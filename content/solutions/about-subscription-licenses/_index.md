## Overview

Starting with NGINX Plus R33, subscription licenses use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and require usage reporting.  

To get up and running, you’ll need to add a valid license to each instance and make sure usage data can be reported.  

The resources below walk you through upgrading, setting up your environment, and understanding how licensing and reporting work in NGINX Plus.
