## About
[//]: # "These are Markdown comments to guide you through document structure. Remove them as you go, as well as any unnecessary sections."
[//]: # "Use underscores for _italics_, and double asterisks for **bold**."
[//]: # "Backticks are for `monospace`, used sparingly and reserved mostly for executable names - they can cause formatting problems. Avoid them in tables: use italics instead."
F5 NGINX One Console makes it easy to manage NGINX instances across locations and environments. The console lets you monitor and control your NGINX fleet from one placeâ€”you can check configurations, track performance metrics, identify security vulnerabilities, manage SSL certificates, and more. NGINX One Console is part of NGINX One, which includes [NGINX One components](#nginx-one-components).

## Featured content
[//]: # "You can add a maximum of three cards: any extra will not display."
[//]: # "One card will take full width page: two will take half width each. Three will stack like an inverse pyramid."
[//]: # "Some examples of content could be the latest release note, the most common install path, and a popular new feature."
