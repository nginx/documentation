### Commercial Support

For paid customers of NGINX Service Mesh, follow the procedures described in the following knowledge base article: [K000140156](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000140156/).

#### Generate a Support Package

To generate a support package, run the following command:

```bash
nginx-meshctl supportpkg
```

To exclude information about sidecar containers:

```bash
nginx-meshctl supportpkg --disable-sidecar-logs
```

The `supportpkg` command generates a tar file containing information about the state of your NGINX Service Mesh deployment. The package includes logs, component yaml files, events, Pod descriptions, and more. The README contained within the package describes its contents.

### GitHub Issues

{{< note >}}
Paid customers of NGINX Service Mesh should use [Commercial Support](#commercial-support) instead of GitHub Issues.
{{< /note >}}

For NGINX Service Mesh support or issues not addressed by documentation, you can reach out via the Issues tab in the [NGINX Service Mesh GitHub repo](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-service-mesh/issues).

We use issues for bug reports and to discuss new features. Creating issues is good, creating good issues is even better. Filing meaningful bug reports with lots of information in them helps us figure out what to fix when and how it impacts our users. We like bugs because it means people are using our code, and we like fixing them even more.

All issues should follow these guidelines:

- Describe the problem. Include version of Kubernetes, `nginx-meshctl version`, and what Kubernetes platform.
- Include detailed information about how to recreate the issue.
- Include relevant configurations, error messages, and logs.
- Sanitize the data. For example, be mindful of IPs, ports, application names, and URLs.
