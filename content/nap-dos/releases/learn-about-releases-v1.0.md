### Known Issues

- `proxy_request_buffering off` is not supported.

- NGINX App Protect DoS does not protect `grpc` and `http2` services. The traffic is bypassed.

- [TLS fingerprint]({{< relref "directives-and-policy/learn-about-directives-and-policy.md#policy-directive-app_protect_dos_policy_file" >}}) feature is not used in CentOS 7.4 due to the old OpenSSL version. The required OpenSSL version is 1.1.1 or higher.

- Slow POST attack always mitigates with block action while other types of attacks can also be mitigated with redirection or JS challenges.
