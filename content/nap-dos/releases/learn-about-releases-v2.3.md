### Resolved Issues

- Improved Security logger configuration parsing: Detects invalid JSON structure, generates an appropriate message if field/value is not valid, doesn't stop on the first failure.

### Important Notes

- Misconfiguration of `app_protect_dos_monitor` potentially can cause a false attack declaration.
Port configuration should correspond to the port the server listens to.

    For example:

    ```shell
        server {
            listen 8080;
            location / {  app_protect_dos_monitor "myservice.com:8080";  }
        }
    ```

Please note that the above syntax for the Monitor directive is old but still supported.

The new syntax for the Monitor directive is as stated below, where **protocol** and **timeout** arguments are optional and default. Refer to [Learn about Directives and Policy](/nginx-app-protect-dos/directives-and-policy/learn-about-directives-and-policy/#monitor-directive-app_protect_dos_monitor) for more details on Monitor directive new syntax.

For example:

`app_protect_dos_monitor uri=myservice.com:8080/ protocol=http1 timeout=5;`
<br><br>

- `proxy_request_buffering` off is not supported.

- gRPC and HTTP/2 protection require active monitoring of the protected service. The directive `app_protect_dos_monitor` is mandatory for these use cases, otherwise, the attack will not be detected.

- [TLS fingerprint]({{< relref "/nap-dos/directives-and-policy/learn-about-directives-and-policy.md#policy-directive-app_protect_dos_policy_file" >}}) feature is not used in CentOS 7.4 and RHEL 7/UBI 7 due to the old OpenSSL version. The required OpenSSL version is 1.1.1 or higher.

- Slow POST attack always mitigates with block action while other types of attacks can also be mitigated with redirection or JS challenges.

- The recommended option of running NGINX Plus in a Docker Container is with the `daemon off` flag. It's mandatory for UBI 8.
