## Overview

F5 NGINX Security Monitoring tracks activity on NGINX App Protect WAF instances. The dashboards and logs show insights, detect threats, and help improve security policies.

This guide explains how to create a role to give users access to Security Monitoring and assign it to users or groups.

{{< note >}}
This guide follows the principle of least privilege, so users only get access to Security Monitoring. You can create roles with different permissions if needed.

## Before you begin

Make sure you complete these steps:

- Your account must have access to User Management in NGINX Instance Manager. Minimum permissions are:

  - **Module**: Settings
  - **Feature**: User Management
  - **Access**: `READ`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE`

- Use the table below to find the permissions you need:

  | Module(s)                         | Feature(s)            | Access                     | Description                                                                                              |
