To update the CVE list on an offline system, manually download the latest `cve.xml` file on a system with internet access, then copy and apply it on the offline NGINX Instance Manager host.

### Download the CVE file

{{< include "/nim/install/temporary-internet-required-note.md" >}}

On a system with internet access, download the latest CVE file:

```bash
curl -s http://hg.nginx.org/nginx.org/raw-file/tip/xml/en/security_advisories.xml -o cve.xml
```

### Transfer the file

Copy the `cve.xml` file to the offline NGINX Instance Manager host using a secure method such as USB or an internal transfer system.

### Replace the existing file

On the target system, overwrite the existing CVE file and set the appropriate permissions:

```bash
sudo cp cve.xml /usr/share/nms/cve.xml
sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/nms/cve.xml
```

### Restart the service

Restart the Data Plane Manager service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nms-dpm
```

NGINX Instance Manager now uses the updated CVE list.
