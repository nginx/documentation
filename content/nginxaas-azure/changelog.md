## Feb 10, 2025

- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINXaaS Load Balancer for Kubernetes is now Generally Available**

   NGINXaaS can now be used as an external load balancer to route traffic to workloads running in your Azure Kubernetes Cluster. To learn how to set it up, see the [Quickstart Guide]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/quickstart/loadbalancer-kubernetes.md">}}).

## January 23, 2025

- {{< icon-feature >}} **In-place SKU Migration from Standard to Standard V2**

   You can now migrate NGINXaaS for Azure from the Standard plan to the Standard V2 plan without redeploying. We recommend upgrading to the Standard V2 plan to access features like NGINX App Protect WAF and more listen ports. The Standard plan will be retired soon. For migration details, see [migrate from standard]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/troubleshooting/migrate-from-standard.md">}}).

## December 17, 2024

- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINXaaS for Azure can integrate with Azure Network Security Perimeter**

   NGINXaaS can now integrate with [Azure Network Security Perimeter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/network-security-perimeter-concepts). This integration allows users to set up access rules, so their NGINXaaS deployment can retrieve certificates from Azure Key Vault, while blocking all other public access to the key vault. For more information, please refer to the [Configure Network Security Perimeter]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/quickstart/security-controls/certificates.md#configure-network-security-perimeter-nsp" >}}) documentation.

## December 3, 2024

- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINXaaS for Azure now supports the GeoIP2 dynamic module**

   NGINXaaS now supports the [GeoIP2](https://github.com/leev/ngx_http_geoip2_module) dynamic module. For more information, see [GeoIP2 quickstart]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/quickstart/geoip2.md">}}). For a complete list of allowed directives, see the [Configuration Directives List]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/nginx-configuration/overview/#configuration-directives-list" >}}).

## November 18, 2024

- {{% icon-resolved %}} **Consumed NCUs metric more accurately accounts for concurrent connections**

   The consumed NCUs metric now uses the `system.worker_connections` metric to more accurately determine the number of concurrent connections used by NGINX. Previously NGINXaaS was underreporting the number of concurrent connections used by NGINX, improperly omitting connections to upstreams.

   Users may notice an increase in their deployments' consumed NCUs if their deployments are handling a large number of connections. This fix will help to make autoscaling more responsive to changes in incoming traffic. Customers using autoscaling may notice that their deployments scale out if the number of concurrent connections increases significantly.

## November 8, 2024

- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINXaaS for Azure now improves visibility and management of protected files**

   Users can now view the file paths and associated metadata of protected files added to the NGINX configuration of an NGINXaaS deployment, while the file contents remain confidential. Users can also overwrite an existing protected file with new file contents or resubmit it without having to provide the file contents again.

   For more details on protected files, refer to the [Add an NGINX configuration]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/nginx-configuration/nginx-configuration-portal.md#add-an-nginx-configuration" >}}) section.

## October 23, 2024

- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINXaaS Load Balancer for Kubernetes preview release**

  You can now use NGINXaaS as an external load balancer to direct traffic into Kubernetes. For details, see the [quickstart]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/quickstart/loadbalancer-kubernetes.md" >}}).

## October 10, 2024

- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINXaaS for Azure is now generally available in more regions**

## September 13, 2024

- {{< icon-warning >}} **Standard plan retirement**<a name="standard-plan-retirement"></a>

NGINXaaS for Azure now supports the [Standard V2](https://docs.nginx.com/nginxaas/azure/billing/overview) plan. We encourage you to use the Standard V2 plan for all new NGINXaaS deployments from now on to take advantage of additional features like NGINX App Protect WAF and a higher number of listen ports. The Standard V2 plan follows a similar pricing model as the Standard plan.

{{<important>}}The Standard plan will be deprecated and will not be available for new deployments starting November 1, 2024.{{</important>}}

Your current deployments on the Standard plan will continue to function but won't include any of the new features we've introduced in the Standard V2 plan. Additionally, we intend to phase out the Standard plan in the future. When this happens, we will offer a migration path to the Standard V2 plan for existing NGINXaaS deployments on the Standard plan.

- **Recommended action:**

   Update your automation scripts to use the Standard V2 plan. The SKU for the Standard V2 pricing plan is `standardv2_Monthly`.

If you have any questions or concerns, please [contact us](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/~/overview).

## Aug 29, 2024
