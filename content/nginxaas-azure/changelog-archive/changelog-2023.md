## October 31, 2023

- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINXaaS for Azure now supports HTTP/3 and QUIC.**

   NGINXaaS can now serve client requests through HTTP/3 connections. NGINX only supports HTTP/3 on the client side and does not support HTTP/3 to upstreams. NGINXaaS utilizes the [OpenSSL](https://openssl.org/) library; however, the OpenSSL compatibility layer it uses does not support [early data](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_early_data).


   ```nginx
   http {
      server {
         # for better compatibility it's recommended
         # to use the same port for http/3 and https
         listen 443 quic reuseport;
         listen 443 ssl;
         ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/foo.pem;
         ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/foo.key;
         # ...
      }
   }
   ```

   To get started using HTTP/3 and NGINXaaS:

   - Update the [network security group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic#create-security-rules) associated with the NGINXaaS deploymentâ€™s subnet to allow inbound traffic for HTTP/3 UDP ports in the NGINX configuration.
   See our [FAQ]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/faq" >}}), for limits on how many unique ports may be specified in a configuration and a list of restricted ports.

   - Additionally, add a [Managed Identity]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/managed-identity-portal.md" >}}) to your deployment and create [SSL/TLS Certificates]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/ssl-tls-certificates/" >}}). For more information on using NGINX with HTTP/3, see the [HTTP/3 module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v3_module.html).

## January 11, 2023

- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINXaaS is generally available**

   We are pleased to announce the general availability of NGINX as a Service (NGINXaaS), a first-party-like experience as a service co-developed by Microsoft and NGINX and tightly integrated into the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) ecosystem.

   NGINXaaS, powered by [NGINX Plus](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/), is a fully managed service that removes the burden of deploying your own NGINX Plus cluster, installing libraries, upgrading, and managing it.

   NGINXaaS simplifies the process of moving your [existing NGINX configuration]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/nginx-configuration#add-nginx-configuration" >}}) to the Azure cloud. Once your configurations are moved to Azure, [securely manage SSL/TLS certificates and keys stored in Azure Key Vault and reference them within your NGINX configurations]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/ssl-tls-certificates/ssl-tls-certificates-portal.md" >}}). You can [watch your application's traffic in real time]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/monitoring/enable-monitoring" >}}) with Azure monitoring and alerts, and scale your deployment to fit your needs, maximizing cost efficiency.
   You can create, update, and delete your NGINXaaS deployment using the [Azure Resource Manager]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/client-tools/templates.md" >}}), the [Azure SDK]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/client-tools/sdk" >}}), [CLI]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/create-deployment/deploy-azure-cli.md" >}}), and [Terraform]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/create-deployment/deploy-terraform.md" >}}) in addition to the [Azure portal]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/getting-started/create-deployment/" >}}).

   Our new "Standard" plan is ready for production workloads.

   To learn more, refer to the following NGINXaaS documentation:

   - [NGINXaaS for Azure overview]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/overview/overview.md" >}})
   - [NGINXaaS, NGINX Plus, and NGINX Open Source feature comparison]({{< relref "/nginxaas-azure/overview/feature-comparison.md" >}})
