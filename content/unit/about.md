# Universal web app server

NGINX Unit is a lightweight and versatile application runtime that provides the
essential components for your web application as a single open-source server:
running application code (including WebAssembly), serving static assets,
handling TLS and request routing.

Unit was created by [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) team members from scratch to
be highly efficient and fully configurable at runtime. You can read the details
about the latest release in the [news]({{< relref "/unit/news/">}}) section.

- See a quickstart [guide](https://github.com/nginx/unit/) on our GitHub page.
- Browse the [Changelog]({{< relref "/unit/changes/">}}) or see the release notes in the [Releases and announcements]({{< relref "/unit/news/">}}) archive.
- Check out the discussion of our [key features]({{< relref "/unit/keyfeatures.md">}}) for further
   details.
- Peek at our future plans with a GitHub-based [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/nginx/projects/1).
