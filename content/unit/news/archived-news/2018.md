## Unit 1.7 Released

Hi,

I'm glad to announce a new release of NGINX Unit.

This is a bugfix release with a primary focus on the stabilization of
the Node.js module.  We have made great progress with it, and now Node.js
support is in much better shape than before.

```none
Changes with Unit 1.7                                            20 Dec 2018

    *) Change: now rpath is set in Ruby module only if the library was not
       found in default search paths; this allows to meet packaging
       restrictions on some systems.

    *) Bugfix: "disable_functions" and "disable_classes" PHP options set via
       Control API did not work.

    *) Bugfix: Promises on request data in Node.js were not triggered.

    *) Bugfix: various compatibility issues with Node.js applications.

    *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault occurred in Node.js module if
       application tried to read request body after request.end() was
       called.

    *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault occurred in Node.js module if
       application attempted to send header twice.

    *) Bugfix: names of response header fields in Node.js module were
       erroneously treated as case-sensitive.

    *) Bugfix: uncatched exceptions in Node.js were not logged.

    *) Bugfix: global install of Node.js module from sources was broken on
       some systems; the bug had appeared in 1.6.

    *) Bugfix: traceback for exceptions during initialization of Python
       applications might not be logged.

    *) Bugfix: PHP module build failed if PHP interpreter was built with
       thread safety enabled.
```

Highly likely, this is the last release of Unit in 2018, so I would like to
wish you a Happy New Year on the behalf of the entire Unit team.

2018 was an exciting year in Unit development.  Many important features have
been introduced, including:

- Advanced Process Management, which allows scaling application processes
  dynamically depending on the amount of load.  Thanks go to Maxim Romanov
  who primarily worked on this feature.

  Documentation: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#process-management

- Perl, Ruby, and Node.js application support.  Thanks to Alexander Borisov
  who implemented these language modules.

- TLS support and Certificates Storage API that allows to dynamically
  configure TLS certificates.  Thanks to Igor Sysoev who collaborated with
  me on this feature.

  Documentation: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/certificates/

- C API language modules were moved into a separate library; this helped a lot
  with Node.js integration and aids the upcoming Java support.  Thanks again
  to Maxim Romanov for this work.

- Essential access logging support.
  Documentation: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#access-log

- Advanced settings for applications including environment variables, runtime
  arguments, PHP options, and php.ini path customization.

I can’t imagine releasing any of these features without the effort of our QA
engineer, Andrey Zelenkov, who relentlessly improves test coverage of Unit
codebase, runs various fuzzing tests, and reports any suspicious behaviour
to the developers.

In addition, one of the most important achievements of the year was a tangible
improvement of documentation quality.  The unit.nginx.org website is up-to-date
now and covers all the features introduced in the new and previous Unit
releases.  This duty was successfully carried out by our technical writer,
Artem Konev.

Besides, he continues refactoring the documentation and plans to introduce
HowTos for various use cases and applications.  If you have any particular
suggestions concerning applications you’d like to configure with Unit,
please create a feature request in our documentation issue tracker on GitHub:
https://github.com/nginx/unit-docs/issues

Thanks to our system engineers, Andrei Belov and Konstantin Pavlov, who are
toiling over packages in our own repositories and images in Docker hub.

Thanks to our product manager Nick Shadrin who helps us to envision our
strategy and gives excellent talks on conferences around the world.
You can see him in the latest Unit demo session at NGINX Conf 2018:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQZKbIG3uro

Of course, everything I’ve just mentioned wouldn’t be possible without our
vibrant community; our users who are eager to move their projects to Unit;
everyone who reports bugs and suggests features, guiding us to the right path.
We urge everybody to participate via our mailing list at unit/at/nginx.org or
on GitHub: https://github.com/nginx/unit

I gladly mention 洪志道 (Hong Zhi Dao) as one of the most active community
members who not only reports bugs but also reads our code, asks pointed
questions, and regularly sends patches with improvements.  Thank you very much
for your contribution.

Special thanks go to the maintainers of Unit packages in various community
repositories: Sergey A. Osokin (FreeBSD), Ralph Seichter (Gentoo), André
Klitzing (Alpine Linux), and Julian Brost (Arch Linux).  Sorry if I didn't
mention anyone else who maintains Unit packages for other distributions; you
can open an issue for your repository to be included in the Installation
section at unit.nginx.org: https://github.com/nginx/unit-docs/issues

Unfortunately, we weren’t able to achieve each and every of our audacious
goals this year.  The development of some features is postponed until
the upcoming year.

Currently, there is ongoing work on WebSocket support, the Java module,
request routing, and static files serving.

We have already made good progress on the Java module.  This work is underway
in a separate GitHub public `repository <https://github.com/mar0x/unit>`__, so
everybody willing to run their Java applications on Unit can participate.

Many other good things and announcements about Unit will surely happen in 2019.
Thank you for staying with us, and all the best.

## Unit 1.5 Released

Hello,

I'm glad to announce a new release of NGINX Unit.

This release introduces preliminary Node.js support.

Currently it lacks WebSockets, and there's a known problem with "promises". However, our admirable users have already started testing it even before the release: https://medium.com/house-organ/what-an-absolute-unit-a36851e72554

Now it even easier, since Node.js package is published in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): https://www.npmjs.com/package/unit-http

So feel free to try it and give us feedback on:

 - Github: https://github.com/nginx/unit/issues
 - Mailing list: https://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/unit

We will continue improving Node.js support in future releases.

Among other features we are working on right now: WebSockets, Java module, flexible request routing, and serving of static media assets.

```none
Changes with Unit 1.5                                            25 Oct 2018

    *) Change: the "type" of application object for Go was changed to
       "external".

    *) Feature: initial version of Node.js package with basic HTTP
       request-response support.

    *) Feature: compatibility with LibreSSL.

    *) Feature: --libdir and --incdir ./configure options to install libunit
       headers and static library.

    *) Bugfix: connection might be closed prematurely while sending
       response; the bug had appeared in 1.3.

    *) Bugfix: application processes might have stopped handling requests,
       producing "last message send failed: Resource temporarily
       unavailable" alerts in log; the bug had appeared in 1.4.

    *) Bugfix: Go applications didn't work when Unit was built with musl C
       library.
```

## Unit 1.4 Released

Hello,

I'm glad to announce a new release of NGINX Unit.

The key feature of the new version is dynamically configurable TLS support
with certificate storage API that provides detailed information about your
certificate chains, including common and alternative names as well as
expiration dates.

See the documentation for details:
https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/certificates/

This is just our first step in TLS support. More configuration options
and various TLS-related features will be added in the future.

Full-featured HTTP/2 support is also in our sights.

```none
   Changes with Unit 1.4                                            20 Sep 2018

       *) Change: the control API maps the configuration object only at
          "/config/".

       *) Feature: TLS support for client connections.

       *) Feature: TLS certificates storage control API.

       *) Feature: Unit library (libunit) to streamline language module
          integration.

       *) Feature: "408 Request Timeout" responses while closing HTTP
          keep-alive connections.

       *) Feature: improvements in OpenBSD support. Thanks to David Carlier.

       *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might have occurred after
          reconfiguration.

       *) Bugfix: building on systems with non-default locale might be broken.

       *) Bugfix: "header_read_timeout" might not work properly.

       *) Bugfix: header fields values with non-ASCII bytes might be handled
          incorrectly in Python 3 module.
```

In a few weeks, we are going to add preliminary Node.js support. It's almost
ready; our QA engineers are already testing it.

Now we are also working on Java module, WebSockets support, flexible request
routing, and serving of static media assets.

Please also welcome Artem Konev, who joined our team as a technical writer. He
has already started improving documentation on the website and updated it with
the configuration options currently available:
https://github.com/nginx/unit-docs/

Of course, the website still leaves much to be desired, so Artem will strive to
provide industry-grade documentation for Unit. You are welcome to join this
effort with your ideas, suggestions, and edits: just send a pull request or
open an issue in our documentation repository on GitHub:
https://github.com/nginx/unit-docs/

Stay tuned!

## Unit 1.3 Released

Hello,

I'm glad to announce a new release of NGINX Unit.

```none
   Changes with Unit 1.3                                            13 Jul 2018

       *) Change: UTF-8 characters are now allowed in request header field
          values.

       *) Feature: configuration of the request body size limit.

       *) Feature: configuration of various HTTP connection timeouts.

       *) Feature: Ruby module now automatically uses Bundler where possible.

       *) Feature: http.Flusher interface in Go module.

       *) Bugfix: various issues in HTTP connection errors handling.

       *) Bugfix: requests with body data might be handled incorrectly in PHP
          module.

       *) Bugfix: individual PHP configuration options specified via control
          API were reset to previous values after the first request in
          application process.
```

Here's an example configuration with new parameters:

```json
   {
       "settings": {
           "http": {
               "header_read_timeout": 30,
               "body_read_timeout": 30,
               "send_timeout": 30,
               "idle_timeout": 180,
               "max_body_size": 8388608
           }
       },

       "listeners": {
           "127.0.0.1:8034": {
               "application": "mercurial"
           }
       },

       "applications": {
           "mercurial": {
               "type": "python 2",
               "module": "hgweb",
               "path": "/data/hg"
           }
       }
   }
```

All timeouts values are specified in seconds. The `max_body_size` value is specified in bytes.

Please note that the parameters of the `http` object in this example are set to their default values. So, there's no need to set them explicitly if you are happy with the values above.

Binary Linux packages and Docker images are available here:

- Packages:  https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/installation/#official-packages
- Docker:    https://hub.docker.com/r/nginx/unit/tags/
