## Unit 1.21.0 Released

Hi,

I'm glad to announce a new release of NGINX Unit.

Our two previous releases were thoroughly packed with new features and
capabilities, but Unit 1.21.0 isn't an exception either. This is our
third big release in a row, with only six weeks since the previous one!

Perhaps, the most notable feature of this release is the support for
multithreaded request handling in application processes. Now, you can
fine-tune the number of threads used for request handling in each
application process; this improves scaling and optimizes memory usage.

As a result, your apps can use a combination of multiple processes and
multiple threads per each process for truly dynamic scaling; the feature
is available for any Java, Python, Perl, or Ruby apps out of the box
without any need to update their code.

Moreover, if you make use of ASGI support in Unit (introduced in the
previous release), each thread of each process of
your application can run asynchronously.

To configure the number of threads per process, use the `threads` option
of the application object: [https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#applications](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#applications)

Yet another cool feature is the long-awaited support for regular expressions.
In Unit, they enable granular request filtering and routing via our compound
matching rules; now, with PCRE syntax available, your request matching
capabilities are limited only by your imagination. For details and examples,
see our documentation: [https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#routes](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#routes)

## Unit 1.20.0 Released

Hi,

I'm glad to announce a new release of NGINX Unit.

It is yet another big release, featuring ASGI support for Python and a long list
of other improvements and bug fixes.

[ASGI 3.0](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a modern standardized
interface that enables writing natively asynchronous web applications making
use of the async/await feature available in latest versions of Python. Now,
Unit fully supports it along with WSGI. Even more, Unit automatically detects
the interface your Python app is using (ASGI or WSGI); the configuration
experience remains the same, though. Also, our take on ASGI relies on Unit's
native high-performance capabilities to implement WebSockets.

To learn more about the new feature, check out the documentation:
[https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#python](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#python)

In addition, we've prepared for you a couple of howtos on configuring popular
ASGI-based frameworks with Unit:

- [Quart](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/howto/quart/) (note a simple WebSocket app)
- [Starlette](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/howto/starlette/)

Finally, we've updated the Django howto to include the [ASGI alternative](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/howto/django/#asgi-interface).

### Full Changelog

```none
Changes with Unit 1.20.0                                         08 Oct 2020

    *) Change: the PHP module is now initialized before chrooting; this
       enables loading all extensions from the host system.

    *) Change: AVIF and APNG image formats added to the default MIME type
       list.

    *) Change: functional tests migrated to the pytest framework.

    *) Feature: the Python module now fully supports applications that use
       the ASGI 3.0 server interface.

    *) Feature: the Python module now has a built-in WebSocket server
       implementation for applications, compatible with the HTTP & WebSocket
       ASGI Message Format 2.1 specification.

    *) Feature: automatic mounting of an isolated "/tmp" file system into
       chrooted application environments.

    *) Feature: the $host variable contains a normalized "Host" request
       value.

    *) Feature: the "callable" option sets Python application callable
       names.

    *) Feature: compatibility with PHP 8 RC 1. Thanks to Remi Collet.

    *) Feature: the "automount" option in the "isolation" object allows to
       turn off the automatic mounting of language module dependencies.

    *) Bugfix: "pass"-ing requests to upstreams from a route was broken; the
       bug had appeared in 1.19.0. Thanks to 洪志道 (Hong Zhi Dao) for
       discovering and fixing it.

    *) Bugfix: the router process could crash during reconfiguration.

    *) Bugfix: a memory leak occurring in the router process; the bug had
       appeared in 1.18.0.

    *) Bugfix: the "!" (non-empty) pattern was matched incorrectly; the bug
       had appeared in 1.19.0.

    *) Bugfix: fixed building on platforms without sendfile() support,
       notably NetBSD; the bug had appeared in 1.16.0.
```

I would very much like to highlight one of these changes. Perhaps the least
noticeable, it is still important for the entire project: our functional tests
moved to a more feature-rich pytest framework from the native Python unittest
module that we've used previously. This change should enable us to write more
sophisticated tests, boosting the overall quality of our future releases.

All in all, this is a genuinely solid release, but I'm still more excited
about the things yet to come. Yes, even more great features are coming our
way very shortly! Right now, we are tinkering with route matching patterns
to support regular expressions; working on keepalive connection caching;
adding multithreading to application modules; and finally, fabricating the
metrics API!

We encourage you to follow our roadmap on GitHub, where your ideas and requests
are always more than welcome: [https://github.com/orgs/nginx/projects/1](https://github.com/orgs/nginx/projects/1)

## Unit 1.19.0 Released

Hi,

I'm always happy to announce a new release of NGINX Unit, but this one's BIG.
Besides the varied features and bugfixes, some breakthrough improvements were
made under the hood.

As you may know, Unit uses an advanced architecture that relies on dedicated
processes to serve different roles in request processing. The process that
handles client connections is the router. It uses asynchronous threads (one
per CPU core) to accept new connections and send or receive data over already
established connections in a non-blocking manner. For security and scalability,
all applications run as separate processes over which you have a degree of
control: [https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#process-management](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#process-management)

To talk to application processes, relay requests for actual processing,
and obtain their responses, the router process uses an elaborate mechanism
of inter-process communication (IPC) based on shared memory segments.
The general idea is to avoid copying data between processes and minimize
overhead, potentially achieving almost zero-latency application interaction.

Our first implementation of this protocol used a complex algorithm to
distribute requests between processes, heavily utilizing Unix socket pairs
to pass synchronization control messages. In practice, this turned out
rather sub-optimal due to lots of extra syscalls and overt complexity.
Also, the push semantics became a serious limitation that prevented us
from efficiently handling asynchronous applications.

Thus, we stepped back a bit at the end of the last year to meticulously
reconsider our approach to IPC, and now this tremendous work finally sees
the light of day with the release of Unit version 1.19.0. Maintaining the
progress achieved while working with shared memory segments, the protocol now
is enhanced to bring the number of syscalls almost to zero under heavy load.
We have also changed the request distribution semantics. Now, instead of
pushing requests to application processes using a complex router process
algorithm, we make application processes pull requests out of a shared
queue anytime they're ready. This enables implementing async interfaces
in applications in the most effective manner.

Relying on this new approach to IPC, we shall be able to improve the
performance of Go and Node.js modules in the upcoming releases, also
introducing multithreading and new interfaces, such as ASGI in Python.

We are obsessed over performance and will continue optimizing Unit to
make it the best and brightest in every aspect.

As for the other features of the release, there's an improvement in proxying:
now it speaks HTTP/1.1 and accepts chunked responses from backends.

Moreover, request matching rules were also upgraded to enable more complex
wildcard patterns like `*/some/*/path/*.php*`.

Finally, we have introduced our first configuration variables. They are
a small bunch at the moment, but that's to change. In a while, variables
shall be sufficiently diversified and will be available in more and more
options.

       to lower latencies, increase performance, and improve scalability.

    *) Feature: support for an arbitrary number of wildcards in route
       matching patterns.

    *) Feature: chunked transfer encoding in proxy responses.

    *) Feature: basic variables support in the "pass" option.

       failed to start; the bug had appeared in 1.18.0.

    *) Bugfix: memory leak during reconfiguration.

    *) Bugfix: the daemon didn't start without language modules; the bug had
       appeared in 1.18.0.

    *) Bugfix: the router process could crash at exit.

    *) Bugfix: Node.js applications could crash at exit.

    *) Bugfix: the Ruby module could be linked against a wrong library
       version.

## Unit 1.18.0 Released

Hi,

I'm glad to announce a new release of NGINX Unit.

This release includes a few internal routing improvements that simplify some
configurations and a new isolation option for chrooting application processes
called `rootfs`.

```none
Changes with Unit 1.18.0                                        28 May 2020

    *) Feature: the "rootfs" isolation option for changing root filesystem
       for an application.

    *) Feature: multiple "targets" in PHP applications.

    *) Feature: support for percent encoding in the "uri" and "arguments"
       matching options and in the "pass" option.
```

Also, our official packages for the recently released Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)
are available now: [https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/installation/#ubuntu](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/installation/#ubuntu)

At least two of the features in this release deserve special attention.

### Changing The Root Filesystem

Security is our top priority, so let's look closer at the `rootfs`
option first.

The coolest thing about it is that it's not just a simple `chroot()`
system call as some may expect. It's not a secret that `chroot()` is
not intended for security purposes, and there's plenty of ways for an attacker
to get out of the chrooted directory (just check "man 2 chroot"). That's why
on modern systems Unit can use `pivot_root()` with the `mount`
namespace isolation enabled, which is way more secure and pretty similar to
putting your application in an individual container.

Also, our goal is to make any security option as easy to use as possible.
In this case, Unit automatically tries to mount all the necessary
language-specific dependencies inside a new root, so you won't need
to care about them. Currently, this capability works for selected languages
only, but the support will be extended in the next releases.

For more information and examples of `rootfs` usage, check the
documentation: [https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#process-isolation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#process-isolation)

Now to the second feature...

### Multiple PHP Application "Targets"

The other major update in this release is called `targets`, aiming to
simplify configuration for many PHP applications. Perhaps, it is best
illustrated by an example: WordPress. This is one of many applications that
use two different addressing schemes:

1. Most user requests are handled by `index.php` regardless of the actual
   request URI.

2. Administration interface and some components rely on direct requests
   to specific `.php` scripts named in the URI.

Earlier, users had to configure two Unit applications to handle this disparity:

```json
{
    "wp_index": {
        "type": "php",
        "user": "wp_user",
        "group": "wp_user",
        "root": "/path/to/wordpress/",
        "script": "index.php"
    },

    "wp_direct": {
        "type": "php",
        "user": "wp_user",
        "group": "wp_user",
        "root": "/path/to/wordpress/"
    }
}
```

The first app directly executes the `.php` scripts named by the URI,
whereas the second one passes all requests to `index.php`.

Now, you can use `targets` instead:

```json
{
    "wp": {
        "type": "php",
        "user": "wp_user",
        "group": "wp_user",

        "targets": {
            "index": {
                "root": "/path/to/wordpress/",
                "script": "index.php"
            },

            "direct": {
                "root": "/path/to/wordpress/"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The complete example is available in our WordPress howto:
[https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/howto/wordpress/](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/howto/wordpress/)

You can configure as many `targets` in one PHP application as you want,
routing requests between them using various sophisticated request matching
rules.

Check our website to know more about the new option:
[https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration#targets](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#targets)

To learn more about request matching rules:

Finally, see here for more howtos:

## Unit 1.17.0 Released

Hi,

I'm glad to announce a new release of NGINX Unit.

In addition to improved stability, this release introduces two handy features.

The first one is configured using the `return` and `location`
options of the action object. It can be used to immediately generate a simple
HTTP response with an arbitrary status - for example, to deny access to some
resources:

```json
{
    "match": {
        "uri": "*/.git/*"
    },

    "action": {
        "return": 403
    }
}
```

Or, you can redirect a client to another resource:

```json
{
    "match": {
        "host": "example.org"
    },

    "action": {
        "return": 301,
        "location": "http://www.example.org"
    }
}
```

See the documentation for a detailed description of routing:
[https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#routes](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#routes)

The second new feature of the release is mostly syntax sugar rather than new
functionality. Now, you can specify servers' weights in an upstream group
using fractional numbers.

Say, you have a bunch of servers and want one of them to receive half as many
requests as the others for some reason. Previously, the only way to achieve
that was to double the weights of all the other servers:

```json
{
    "192.168.0.101:8080": {
        "weight": 2
    },
    "192.168.0.102:8080": {
        "weight": 2
    },
    "192.168.0.103:8080": {},
    "192.168.0.104:8080": {
        "weight": 2
    }
}
```

Using fractional weights, you can perform the update much easier by altering
the weight of the server in question:

```json
{
    "192.168.0.101:8080": {},
    "192.168.0.102:8080": {},
    "192.168.0.103:8080": {
        "weight": 0.5
    },
    "192.168.0.104:8080": {}
}
```

For details of server groups, see here:

```none
Changes with Unit 1.17.0                                         16 Apr 2020

    *) Feature: a "return" action with optional "location" for immediate
       responses and external redirection.

    *) Feature: fractional weights support for upstream servers.

    *) Bugfix: accidental 502 "Bad Gateway" errors might have occurred in
       applications under high load.

    *) Bugfix: memory leak in the router; the bug had appeared in 1.13.0.

    *) Bugfix: segmentation fault might have occurred in the router process
       when reaching open connections limit.

    *) Bugfix: "close() failed (9: Bad file descriptor)" alerts might have
       appeared in the log while processing large request bodies; the bug
       had appeared in 1.16.0.

    *) Bugfix: existing application processes didn't reopen the log file.

    *) Bugfix: incompatibility with some Node.js applications.

    *) Bugfix: broken build on DragonFly BSD; the bug had appeared in
       1.16.0.
```

## Unit 1.16.0 Released

Hi,

I'm glad to announce a new release of NGINX Unit.

{{< note >}}
To all Unit package maintainers: please don't miss the new `--tmp`
configure option.  It specifies the directory where the Unit daemon
stores temporary files (i.e. large request bodies) at runtime.
{{< /note >}}

In this release, we continue improving the functionality related to proxying
and static media asset handling.

Now, the new `upstreams` object enables creating server groups for
weighted round-robin load balancing:

```json
{
    "listeners": {
        "*:80": {
            "pass": "upstreams/rr-lb"
        }
    },

    "upstreams": {
        "rr-lb": {
            "servers": {
                "192.168.0.100:8080": {},
                "192.168.0.101:8080": {
                    "weight": 2
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

See the docs for details:
[https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#configuration-upstreams](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#configuration-upstreams)

So far, it's rather basic, but many more proxying and load-balancing
features are planned for future releases.

By its design, the new `fallback` option is somewhat similar to the
`try_files` directive in `nginx`.  It allows proceeding to
another action if a file isn't available:

```json
{
    "share": "/data/www/",

    "fallback": {
        "pass": "applications/php"
    }
}

```

In the example above, an attempt is made first to serve a request
with a file from the `/data/www/` directory.  If there's no such
file, the request is passed to the `php` application.

Also, you can chain such fallback actions:

```json
{
    "share": "/data/www/",

    "fallback": {
        "share": "/data/cache/",

        "fallback": {
            "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:9000"
        }
    }
}

```

More info: [https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#configuration-fallback](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/configuration/#configuration-fallback)

Finally, configurations you upload can use line (`//`) and block
(`/* */`) comments.  Now, Unit doesn't complain; instead, it strips them
from the JSON payload.  This comes in handy if you store your configuration in
a file and edit it manually.

```none
Changes with Unit 1.16.0                                         12 Mar 2020

    *) Feature: basic load-balancing support with round-robin.

    *) Feature: a "fallback" option that performs an alternative action if a
       request can't be served from the "share" directory.

    *) Feature: reduced memory consumption by dumping large request bodies
       to disk.

    *) Feature: stripping UTF-8 BOM and JavaScript-style comments from
       uploaded JSON.

    *) Bugfix: negative address matching in router might work improperly in
       combination with non-negative patterns.

    *) Bugfix: Java Spring applications failed to run; the bug had appeared
       in 1.10.0.

    *) Bugfix: PHP 7.4 was broken if it was built with thread safety
       enabled.

    *) Bugfix: compatibility issues with some Python applications.
```

To keep the finger on the pulse, see our further plans in the roadmap here:
[https://github.com/orgs/nginx/projects/1](https://github.com/orgs/nginx/projects/1)

Also, good news for macOS users!  Now, there's a Homebrew tap for Unit:
[https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/installation/#homebrew](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-unit/installation/#homebrew)

## Unit 1.15.0 Released

Hi,

I'm glad to announce a new release of NGINX Unit.

This is mostly a bugfix release that eliminates a few nasty issues.
Also, it addresses incompatibilities caused by a minor API change in
the recently released major version of Ruby.

```none
Changes with Unit 1.15.0                                         06 Feb 2020

    *) Change: extensions of dynamically requested PHP scripts were
       restricted to ".php".

    *) Feature: compatibility with Ruby 2.7.

    *) Bugfix: segmentation fault might have occurred in the router process
       with multiple application processes under load; the bug had appeared
       in 1.14.0.

    *) Bugfix: receiving request body over TLS connection might have
       stalled.
```

More features are planned for the next release that is expected in the
beginning of March.  Among them are basic load balancing in the proxy module
and `try_files`-like functionality for more sophisticated request
routing.
