## Overview

This document explains how to manage users and accounts in F5 NGINXaaS for Google Cloud (NGINXaaS).

The following concepts are important to understand:

- NGINXaaS Accounts (point to the "sign up" docs which creates an account)
- Users - must tie to a Google identity



## Add or edit a user

## Modify account settings

- Authorized domains, and how they work

## Switch accounts

## Delete a user

- User will no longer be able to access the NGINXaaS account. Not reversible.
