Learn about the architecture and design principles of NGINX Gateway Fabric: a Kubernetes Gateway API implementation which uses NGINX as the data plane. 

This document is intended for:

- _Cluster Operators_ who want to understand how NGINX Gateway Fabric works in production, how it manages traffic, and how to troubleshoot failures.

- _Application Developers_ who would like to use NGINX Gateway Fabric to expose and route traffic to their applications within Kubernetes.

The reader needs to be familiar with core Kubernetes concepts, such as pods, deployments, services, and endpoints. For an understanding of how NGINX itself works, you can read the ["Inside NGINX: How We Designed for Performance & Scale"](https://www.nginx.com/blog/inside-nginx-how-we-designed-for-performance-scale/) blog post.

If you are interested in contributing to the project or learning about its internal implementation details, please see the [Developer Architecture Guide](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/tree/main/docs/architecture).

## NGINX Gateway Fabric Deployment Model and Architectural Overview

NGINX Gateway Fabric splits its architecture into two main parts to provide better security, flexibility, and reliability:

### Control Plane: Centralized Management

The control plane operates as a Deployment, serving as a [Kubernetes controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) built with the [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) library. It manages all aspects of resource provisioning and configuration for the NGINX data planes by watching Gateway API resources and other Kubernetes objects such as Services, Endpoints, and Secrets.

Key functionalities include:

- Dynamic provisioning: When a new Gateway resource is created, the control plane automatically provisions a dedicated NGINX Deployment and exposes it using a Service.
- Configuration management: Kubernetes and Gateway API resources are translated into NGINX configurations, which are securely delivered to the data plane pods via a gRPC connection to the NGINX Agent.
- Secure communication: By default, the gRPC connection uses self-signed certificates generated during installation. Integration with [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is also supported for optional certificate management.

### Data Plane: Autonomous Traffic Management

Each NGINX data plane pod can be provisioned as an independent Deployment or DaemonSet containing an `nginx` container. This container runs both the `nginx` process and the [NGINX agent](https://github.com/nginx/agent), which is responsible for:

- Applying configurations: The agent receives updates from the control plane and applies them to the NGINX instance.
- Handling reloads: NGINX Agent handles configuration reconciliation and reloading NGINX, eliminating the need for shared volumes or Unix signals between the control plane and data plane pods.

### Gateway Resource Management

Users can have multiple gateways running side-by-side in the same cluster. This supports flexible operation and isolation across Gateways:

- Concurrent Gateways: Multiple Gateway objects can run simultaneously within a single installation.
- 1:1 resource mapping: Each Gateway resource corresponds uniquely to a dedicated data plane deployment, ensuring clear delineation of ownership and operational segregation.

| ---| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1  | Kubernetes API (HTTPS)  | _Kubernetes API â†’ NGINX Gateway Fabric Control Plane Pod_: The NGINX Gateway Fabric Control Plane Pod (in the `nginx-gateway` namespace) watches the Kubernetes API for updates to Gateway API resources (e.g., Gateways, HTTPRoutes), fetching the latest configuration to manage routing and traffic control. |
| 2  | gRPC                    | _NGINX Gateway Fabric Control Plane Pod â†’ NGINX Agent_: The NGINX Gateway Fabric Control Plane Pod processes Gateway API resources, generates NGINX configuration settings, and securely delivers them to the NGINX Agent inside the NGINX Data Plane Pod via gRPC. |
| 3  | File I/O                | _NGINX Agent â†’ Config Files_: The NGINX Agent (within the NGINX Data Plane Pod) validates the configuration metadata received from the Control Plane Pod and writes it to NGINX configuration files within the pod. These files store dynamic routing rules and traffic settings. |
| 4  | Signal                  | _NGINX Agent â†’ NGINX Master_: After writing the configuration files, the NGINX Agent signals the NGINX Master process to reload the configuration. This ensures the NGINX Data Plane Pod immediately applies the updated routes and settings. |
| 5  | HTTP/HTTPS              | _Prometheus â†’ NGINX Worker_: Prometheus collects runtime metrics (e.g., traffic statistics, request rates, and active connections) from the NGINX Worker process, which is part of the NGINX Data Plane Pod. The `/metrics` endpoint exposes these metrics for monitoring and observability. |
| 6  | HTTPS                   | _NGINX Gateway Fabric Control Plane Pod â†’ F5 Telemetry Service_: The NGINX Gateway Fabric Control Plane Pod sends telemetry data (e.g., API requests handled, usage metrics, performance stats, error rates) to the external F5 Telemetry Service for centralized monitoring and diagnostics. |
| 7  | HTTP/HTTPS              | _Client â†’ NGINX Worker_: Clients send incoming application traffic (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS requests) to the NGINX Worker process within the NGINX Data Plane Pod. These requests are typically routed through a shared Public Endpoint (e.g., LoadBalancer or NodePort) before reaching the NGINX Data Plane. |
| 8  | HTTP/HTTPS              | _NGINX Worker â†’ Backend Application_: The NGINX Worker process forwards client traffic to the appropriate backend application services (e.g., Pods) as defined in the routing rules and configuration received from the Control Plane Pod. |

### Additional features and enhancements when using NGINX Plus

NGINX Gateway Fabric supports both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. While the previous diagram shows NGINX Open Source, using NGINX Plus provides additional capabilities, including:

- The ability for administrators to connect to the NGINX Plus API on port 8765 (restricted to localhost by default).
- Dynamic updates to upstream servers without requiring a full reload:
  - Changes to upstream servers, such as application scaling (e.g., adding or removing pods in Kubernetes), can be applied using the [NGINX Plus API](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html).
  - This reduces the frequency of configuration reloads, minimizing potential disruptions and improving system stability during updates.

These features enable reduced downtime, improved performance during scaling events, and more fine-grained control over traffic management.

---

### Resilience and fault isolation

This architecture separates the control plane and data plane, creating clear operational boundaries that improve resilience and fault isolation:

#### Control plane resilience

In the event of a control plane failure or downtime:
- Existing data plane pods continue serving traffic using their last-valid cached configurations.
- Updates to routes or Gateways are temporarily paused, but stable traffic delivery continues without degradation.
- Recovery restores functionality, resynchronizing configuration updates seamlessly.

#### Data plane resilience

If a data plane pod encounters an outage or restarts:
- Only routes tied to the specific linked Gateway object experience brief disruptions.
- Configurations automatically resynchronize with the data plane upon pod restart, minimizing the scope of impact.
- Other data plane pods remain unaffected and continue serving traffic normally.

---

## Pod readiness

The control plane (`nginx-gateway`) and data plane (`nginx`) containers provide a readiness endpoint at `/readyz`. A [readiness probe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-readiness-probes) periodically checks this endpoint during startup. The probe reports `200 OK` when:
- The control plane is ready to configure the NGINX data planes.
- The data plane is ready to handle traffic.

This marks the pods ready ensuring traffic is routed to healthy pods, ensuring reliable startup and smooth operations.
