This guide provides step-by-step instructions for upgrading NGINX Gateway Fabric from version 1.x to 2.x, highlighting key architectural changes, expected downtime, and important considerations for custom resource definitions (CRDs).

## Upgrade from v1.x to v2.x

To upgrade NGINX Gateway Fabric from version 1.x to the new architecture in version 2.x, you must uninstall the existing NGINX Gateway Fabric CRDs and deployment, and perform a fresh installation. This will cause brief downtime during the upgrade process.

{{<note>}} You do not need to uninstall the Gateway API CRDs during the upgrade. These resources are compatible with the new NGINX Gateway Fabric version. {{</note>}}

### Uninstall NGINX Gateway Fabric v1.x

To remove the previous version 1.x of NGINX Gateway Fabric, follow these steps:

First, run the following command to uninstall NGINX Gateway Fabric from the `nginx-gateway` namespace, and update `ngf` to your release name if it is different:

```shell
helm uninstall ngf -n nginx-gateway 
```

Afterwards, remove CRDs associated with NGINX Gateway Fabric version 1.x with the following command:

```shell
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/v1.6.2/deploy/crds.yaml
```

{{<tabs name="install-ngf-2.x">}}

{{%tab name="Helm"%}}

Follow these steps to install NGINX Gateway Fabric v2.x using Helm:

Next, install the latest stable release of NGINX Gateway Fabric in the `nginx-gateway` namespace. The following `helm install` command will install the NGINX Gateway Fabric release along with the necessary CRDs required for the deployment:

```shell
helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginx/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway
```

For additional customization options during the helm installation process, take a look at [Installation with Helm]({{< ref "/ngf/install/helm.md" >}}).

{{%tab name="Manifests"%}}

Follow these steps to install NGINX Gateway Fabric v2.x using Manifests:

Apply the new CRDs with the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/v{{< version-ngf >}}/deploy/crds.yaml
```

Next, install the latest stable release of NGINX Gateway Fabric in the `nginx-gateway` namespace with the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/v{{< version-ngf >}}/deploy/default/deploy.yaml
```

For additional customization options during the installation process using manifests, take a look at [Installation with Manifests]({{< ref "/ngf/install/manifests.md" >}}).

## Architecture changes

With this release, NGINX Gateway Fabric adopts a new architecture that separates the control plane and data plane into independent deployments. This separation improves scalability, security, and operational clarity.

The control plane is a Kubernetes controller that watches Gateway API and Kubernetes resources (e.g., Services, Endpoints, Secrets) and dynamically provisions NGINX data plane deployments for each Gateway.

NGINX configurations are generated by the control plane and securely delivered to the data planes via gRPC, using the NGINX Agent. TLS is enabled by default, with optional integration with `cert-manager`.

Each data plane pod runs NGINX alongside the Agent, which applies config updates and handles reloads without shared volumes or signals. This design ensures dynamic, per-Gateway traffic management and operational isolation.

New fields have been added to the `NginxProxy` resource to configure infrastructure-related settings for data plane deployments. The `NginxProxy` resource is now a namespaced-scoped resource, instead of a cluster-scoped resource, and can be modified at either the Gateway or GatewayClass level. These new fields provide the flexibility to customize deployment and service configurations.

For detailed instructions on how to modify these settings, refer to the [Configure infrastructure-related settings]({{< ref "/ngf/how-to/data-plane-configuration.md#configure-infrastructure-related-settings" >}}) guide.

## Access NGINX Gateway Fabric 1.x documentation

The documentation website is intended for the latest version of NGINX Gateway Fabric.

To review documentation prior to 2.x, check out the desired release branch (Such as _release-1.6_):

```shell
git clone git@github.com:nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric.git
git checkout release-1.6
```

To review the documentation in a local webserver, run _make watch_ in the _/site_ folder:

```shell
cd site
make watch
```
