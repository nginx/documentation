You can use F5 NGINX One Console API to manage your Staged Configurations. With our API, you can:

- [Create an NGINX Staged Configuration]({{< relref "/nginx-one/api/api-reference-guide/#operation/createStagedConfig" >}})
  - The details allow you to add existing configuration files.
- [Get a list of existing Staged Configurations]({{< relref "/nginx-one/api/api-reference-guide/#operation/listStagedConfigs" >}})
  - Be sure to record the `object_id` of your target Staged Configuration for your analysis report.
- [Get an analysis report for an existing Staged Configuration]({{< relref "/nginx-one/api/api-reference-guide/#operation/getStagedConfigReport" >}})
