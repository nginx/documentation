The NGINX One glossary is a short dictionary of terminology used by NGINX One and F5 Distributed Cloud.

## Namespace

In the context of F5 Distributed Cloud, namespaces group a tenantâ€™s configuration objects and can be thought of as administrative domains. All objects of the same kind must have unique names within a given namespace, and the namespaces themselves must be unique within a tenant. Namespaces provide isolation within a tenant, ensuring objects in one namespace cannot be referred to by another.

## Tenant
A tenant in F5 Distributed Cloud is an entity that owns a specific set of configuration and infrastructure. It is a fundamental concept for isolation, meaning a tenant cannot access objects or infrastructure of other tenants. Tenants can be of two types: **individual** and **enterprise**, with the latter allowing multiple users with role-based access control (RBAC) roles.
