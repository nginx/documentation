## Introduction

In this lab, you’ll run a demo backend application and several NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus containers with Docker. The backend application runs in three `nginxinc/ingress-demo` containers, each serving a simple web page. You’ll also connect each NGINX container to the NGINX One Console for management and monitoring.

---

## What you’ll learn

By the end of this tutorial, you can:

- Set environment variables for your data plane key and license
- Log in to the NGINX private registry
- Generate self-signed certificates
- Run Docker Compose to start nine containers
- Verify your containers in Docker and in NGINX One Console

---

## Before you begin



Make sure you have:

- {{< include "nginx-one/workshops/xc-account.md" >}}
- Docker and Docker Compose installed and running
- An active data plane key from [Lab 1: Get started with NGINX One Console]({{< ref "nginx-one/workshops/lab1/getting-started-with-nginx-one.md" >}})
- A trial or paid NGINX One JWT license (saved as `nginx-repo.jwt`) from [MyF5](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/)
- Basic Linux and NGINX knowledge
- Git installed and an SSH key set up for GitHub access

---

## Clone the NGINX documentation repo

1. **Clone the repo via SSH**

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:nginx/documentation.git
   ```

2. **Change to the Lab 2 directory**

   ```shell
   cd static/workshops/nginx-one/lab2
   ```

   This folder contains `compose.yaml` and `generate_certs.sh`.

   {{<fa "download">}} {{<link "/workshops/nginx-one/lab2/compose.yaml" "Download compose.yaml">}}

   {{<fa "download">}} {{<link "/workshops/nginx-one/lab2/generate_certs.sh" "Download generate_certs.sh">}}

---

## Set environment variables

1. **Set your data plane key**

   ```shell
   export TOKEN="paste-your-data-plane-key-here"
   echo "$TOKEN"
   ```

2. **Set your NGINX Plus JWT**

   ```shell
   export JWT=$(cat path/to/nginx-repo.jwt)
   echo "$JWT"
   ```

3. **Give your setup a unique name**

   Replace `your.initials` with something that identifies you (for example, `s.jobs`).

   ```shell
   export NAME="your.initials"
   echo "$NAME"
   ```

---

## Log in to the private registry

Pipe your JWT into Docker login:

```shell
echo "$JWT" | docker login private-registry.nginx.com \
--username "$JWT" --password-stdin
```

You should see **Login Succeeded**.

---

## Generate certificates

Run the script to create self-signed certificates:

```shell
chmod +x generate_certs.sh
./generate_certs.sh
```

This creates `1-day.key`, `1-day.crt`, `30-day.key`, and `30-day.crt` in the `nginx-oss/etc/ssl/nginx` subfolder.

---

## Run Docker Compose

Start all nine containers in detached mode:

```shell
docker compose up --force-recreate -d
```

Wait until you see **Started** for each container.

---

## Verify containers

1. **Check Docker**

   ```shell
   docker ps | grep "$NAME"
   ```

   You should see nine containers listed.

2. **Check NGINX One Console**

   - Go to the **Instances** page in NGINX One Console
   - Refresh and search by your `$NAME` (for example, `s.jobs`)
   - Confirm each instance shows a green **Online** icon

   If you don’t see them, check your `$TOKEN` or generate a new data plane key.

---

## Next steps

Your containers are now up and registered with NGINX One Console.

Go to [Lab 3: Explore NGINX One Console features]({{< ref "nginx-one/workshops/lab3/explore-nginx-one-console-and-features.md" >}}).
