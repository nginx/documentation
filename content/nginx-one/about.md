NGINX One helps users manage multiple NGINX deployments across multiple locations and environments. Traditionally, overseeing these deployments has been a time-consuming and demanding job. With NGINX One, you can monitor and manage your NGINX fleet from an intuitive, centralized console. This console gives insights into the configuration and performance of your NGINX instances, highlights critical vulnerabilities, shows the status of SSL certificates, and more.


## Benefits and Key Features

NGINX One delivers these key advantages:

- **All-in-One Control**: Monitor and manage all your NGINX deployments from one central console.

- **Enhanced Monitoring and Risk Detection**: Automatically identify critical vulnerabilities (CVEs), check the status of SSL certificates, and identify security issues in NGINX configurations.

- **Optimized Performance**: Monitor your installed NGINX versions and get advice on how to optimize your NGINX configurations.

- **Graphical Metrics Display**: View the performance metrics of NGINX instances in a graphical format for straightforward analysis.

- **Real-Time Alerts**: Receive immediate notifications about urgent issues.
