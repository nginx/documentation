The NGINX One Console uses the **[F5 Distributed Cloud User Management](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/administration/how-tos/user-mgmt)** system for access controls and user permissions.
General information can be found on the User Management documentation for **[F5 Distributed Cloud](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/administration/how-tos/user-mgmt)**. This document provides guidance and reference material for utilizing those features to grant and restrict access within the NGINX One Console.

## Custom roles

You can set up [Custom Roles](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs-v2/administration/how-tos/user-mgmt/roles#custom-roles), as described in our F5 Distributed Cloud Services Administration documentation.
