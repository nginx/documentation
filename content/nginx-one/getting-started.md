This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to activate and start using F5 NGINX One Console. NGINX One is a management console for monitoring and managing NGINX data plane instances.

## Enable the NGINX One service {#enable-nginx-one}

To get started using NGINX One, enable the service on F5 Distributed Cloud.

1. Log in to [F5 Distributed Console](https://www.f5.com/cloud/products/distributed-cloud-console).
1. Select **NGINX One** from the list of services.
1. Select **Enable Service**.
1. After the service has been enabled, select **Visit Service** to load NGINX One Console.

## Add your NGINX instances to NGINX One

Next, add your NGINX instances to NGINX One. You'll need to create a data plane key and then install NGINX Agent on each instance you want to monitor.

### Add an instance

Depending on whether this is your first time using NGINX One Console or you've used it before, follow the appropriate steps to add an instance:

- **For first-time users:** On the welcome screen, select **Add Instance**.
- **For returning users:** If you've added instances previously and want to add more, select **Instances** on the left menu, then select **Add Instance**.

### Generate a data plane key {#generate-data-plane-key}

A data plane key is a security token that ensures only trusted NGINX instances can register and communicate with NGINX One.

To generate a data plane key:

- **For a new key:** In the **Add Instance** pane, select **Generate Data Plane Key**.
- **To reuse an existing key:** If you already have a data plane key and want to use it again, select **Use existing key**. Then, enter the key's value in the **Data Plane Key** box.

{{<call-out "caution" "Data plane key guidelines" "fas fa-key" >}}
Data plane keys are displayed only once and cannot be retrieved later. Be sure to copy and store this key securely.

Data plane keys expire after one year. You can change this expiration date later by [editing the key]({{< relref "nginx-one/how-to/data-plane-keys/create-manage-data-plane-keys.md#change-expiration-date" >}}).

[Revoking a data plane key]({{< relref "nginx-one/how-to/data-plane-keys/create-manage-data-plane-keys.md#revoke-data-plane-key" >}}) disconnects all instances that were registered with that key.
{{</call-out>}}


### Install NGINX Agent

After entering your data plane key, you'll see a `curl` command similar to the one below. Copy and run this command on each NGINX instance to install NGINX Agent. Once installed, NGINX Agent typically registers with NGINX One within a few seconds.

{{<call-out "important" "Connecting to NGINX One" >}}
NGINX Agent must be able to establish a connection to NGINX One Console's Agent endpoint (`agent.connect.nginx.com`). Ensure that any firewall rules you have in place for your NGINX hosts allows network traffic to port `443` for all of the following IPs:

- `3.135.72.139`
- `3.133.232.50`
- `52.14.85.249`
{{</call-out>}}

To install NGINX Agent on an NGINX instance:

1. **Check if NGINX is running and start it if it's not:**

    First, see if NGINX is running:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl status nginx
    ```

    If the status isn't `Active`, go ahead and start NGINX:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    ```

2. **Install NGINX Agent:**

    Next, use the `curl` command provided to you to install NGINX Agent:

    ``` shell
    curl https://agent.connect.nginx.com/nginx-agent/install | DATA_PLANE_KEY="YOUR_DATA_PLANE_KEY" sh -s -- -y
    ```

   - Replace `YOUR_DATA_PLANE_KEY` with your actual data plane key.
   - The `-y` option automatically confirms any prompts during installation.

The `install` script writes an `nginx-agent.conf` file to the `/etc/nginx-agent/` directory, with the [data plane key](#generate-data-plane-key) that you generated. You can find this information in the `nginx-agent.conf` file:

```yaml
server:
  token: "<YOUR_DATA_PLANE_KEY>"
  host: agent.connect.nginx.com
  grpcPort: 443

tls:
  enable: True
  skip_verify: False
```

If you followed the [Installation and upgrade](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-agent/installation-upgrade/) guides for installing NGINX Agent, you may need to add this information manually to `nginx-agent.conf`.

<span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 20px;" >

{{<call-out "note" "Note: NGINX Agent poll interval" >}} We recommend keeping `dataplane.status.poll_interval` between `30s` and `60s` in the NGINX Agent config (`/etc/nginx-agent/nginx-agent.conf`). If the interval is set above `60s`, NGINX One Console may report incorrect instance statuses.{{</call-out>}}

## Enable NGINX metrics reporting

In order for NGINX One Console to show specific traffic and system metrics, you need to enable the appropriate API on your NGINX data plane instances. The sections below provide step-by-step instructions for both NGINX Plus and NGINX Open Source (OSS).

### Enable NGINX Plus API

## View instance metrics with the NGINX One dashboard

After connecting your NGINX instances to NGINX One, you can monitor their performance and health. The NGINX One dashboard is designed for this purpose, offering an easy-to-use interface.

### Log in to NGINX One

1. Log in to [F5 Distributed Console](https://www.f5.com/cloud/products/distributed-cloud-console).
1. Select **NGINX One > Visit Service**.

### Overview of the NGINX One dashboard

Navigating the dashboard:

- **Drill down into specifics**: For in-depth information on a specific metric, like expiring certificates, click on the relevant link in the metric's card to go to a detailed overview page.
- **Refine metric timeframe**: Metrics show the last hour's data by default. To view data from a different period, select the time interval you want from the drop-down menu.
