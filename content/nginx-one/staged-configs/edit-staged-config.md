Once you've registered your NGINX Staged Configs with the F5 NGINX One Console, you can view and edit their NGINX configurations on the **Staged Configurations** details page.

To view and edit an NGINX configuration, follow these steps:

1. On the left menu, select **Staged Configurations**.
1. Select the staged configuration you want to view or modify.
1. Select **Edit** to make changes to the current configuration.
1. Make your changes to the configuration files. The configuration analyzer will let you know if there are any errors.
1. When you are satisfied with the changes, select **Next**.
1. Compare and verify your changes before selecting **Save** to publish the edited Staged configuration.
