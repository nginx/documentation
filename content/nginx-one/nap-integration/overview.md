You can now integrate the features of F5 WAF for NGINX v4 and v5 in F5 NGINX One Console. NGINX App Protect offers advanced Web Application Firewall (WAF) capabilities.
Through the NGINX One Console UI, you can now set up the [F5 WAF for NGINX]({{< ref "/nap-waf/" >}}) firewall. This solution provides robust security and scalability.

## Features

Once you've connected to the NGINX One Console, select **App Protect > Policies**. You can add new policies or edit existing policies, as defined in the [F5 WAF for NGINX Administration Guide]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v5/admin-guide/overview.md" >}})

Through the NGINX One Console UI, you can:

- [Add and configure a policy]({{< ref "/nginx-one/nap-integration/configure-policy.md/" >}})
- [Review existing policies]({{< ref "/nginx-one/nap-integration/review-policy.md/" >}})
- [Deploy policies]({{< ref "/nginx-one/nap-integration/deploy-policy.md/" >}}) on instances and Config Sync Groups

You can also set up policies through the [NGINX One Console API]({{< ref "/nginx-one/nap-integration/security-policy-api.md/" >}}).

## Set up NGINX App Protect

You can install and upgrade NGINX App Protect:

Version 4:

- [Install]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install.md" >}})
- [Upgrade]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/upgrade-nap-waf.md" >}})

Version 5:

- [Install]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v5/admin-guide/install.md" >}})
- [Upgrade]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v5/admin-guide/upgrade-nap-waf.md" >}})

### Container-related configuration requirements

F5 WAF for NGINX Version 5 has specific requirements for the configuration with Docker containers:

- Directory associated with the volume, which you may configure in a `docker-compose.yaml` file.
  - You may set it up with the `volumes` directive with a directory like `/etc/nginx/app_protect_policies`.
  - You need to set up the container volume. So when the policy bundle is referenced in the `nginx` directive, the file path is what the container sees.
  - You need to also include an `app_protect_policy_file`, as described in [App Protect Specific Directives]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v5/configuration-guide/configuration.md#app-protect-specific-directives" >}})

  - You'll need to set a policy bundle (in compressed tar format) in a configured `volume`.
  - Make sure the directory for [NGINX Agent]({{< ref "/agent/configuration/" >}}) includes `/etc/nginx/app_protect_policies`.

When  you deploy NAP policy through NGINX One Console, do not also use plain JSON policy in the same NGINX instance.
