Role-based access control (RBAC) is a security system that governs access to resources within a software application. By assigning specific roles to users or groups, RBAC ensures that only authorized individuals have the ability to perform certain actions or access particular areas.

The value of RBAC lies in its ability to provide clear and structured control over what users can see and do. This makes it easier to maintain security, streamline user management, and ensure compliance with internal policies or regulations. By giving users only the permissions they need to fulfill their roles, RBAC reduces the risk of unauthorized access and fosters a more efficient and secure operating environment.
