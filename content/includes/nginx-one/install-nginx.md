If you need to set up an instance of NGINX, you can do so in one of the following ways:

- Install [NGINX Open Source or NGINX Plus]({{< ref "/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/" >}}). You can use the linked guide to install NGINX in a Linux environment, in a VM or on bare-metal hardware.
- [Deploy NGINX and NGINX Plus with Docker]({{< ref "/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-docker.md" >}}) with NGINX and the NGINX Agent installed.
