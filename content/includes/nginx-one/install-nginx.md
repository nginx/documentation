Ensure you have an instance of [NGINX Open Source or NGINX Plus]({{< ref "/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/" >}}) installed and available. This guide will provide instructions for connecting an instance installed in a Linux environment (VM or bare metal hardware) where you have command line access.
Alternatively, we also have instructions for [Deploying NGINX and NGINX Plus with Docker]({{< ref "/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-docker.md" >}}) with NGINX and the NGINX Agent installed. That deployment can connect with environment variables.
