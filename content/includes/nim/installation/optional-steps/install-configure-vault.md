NGINX Instance Manager can use [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) as a datastore for secrets.

To install and enable Vault, follow these steps:

- Follow Vault's instructions to [install Vault 1.8.8 or later](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install) for your distribution.
- Ensure you're running Vault in a [production-hardened environment](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/production-hardening).
- After installing NGINX Instance Manager, follow the steps to [configure Vault for storing secrets]({{< ref "/nim/system-configuration/configure-vault.md" >}}).
