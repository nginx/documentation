| clickhouse.enable            | true                               | Set to `false` to disable metrics collection and run NGINX Instance Manager in lightweight mode. Requires a service restart. |
| clickhouse.address           | tcp://localhost:9000               | The address of the ClickHouse database. |
| clickhouse.username          |                                    | The username NGINX Instance Manager uses to connect to ClickHouse, if authentication is enabled. |

| clickhouse.tls_mode          | false                              | Set to `true` to enable TLS for the ClickHouse connection. This setting will be deprecated in a future release. Use the `clickhouse.tls` section instead. |
| clickhouse.tls.address       | tcp://localhost:9440               | The address NGINX Instance Manager uses to connect to ClickHouse over TLS. Format: `<ip-address>:<port>`. |
| clickhouse.tls.skip_verify   | false                              | Set to `true` to skip TLS certificate verification. Use only for self-signed certificates in non-production environments. |
