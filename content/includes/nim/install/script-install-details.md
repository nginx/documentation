The script installs the **latest** versions of:

- NGINX Open Source
- NGINX Instance Manager
- ClickHouse (by default)

The script also installs all required system packages.

If you need an **earlier version** of NGINX or NGINX Instance Manager, use the [manual installation process]({{< ref "nim/install/vm-bare-metal/install-manually-online.md" >}}) for online setups or the [offline manual process]({{< ref "nim/install/vm-bare-metal/install-manually-offline.md" >}}) for disconnected environments.
