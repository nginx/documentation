{{< call-out "warning" "Wait for the admin password to appear" >}}
After the "Installation is complete" message appears, the script is still running. It generates a new admin password and displays it shortly after.

Don’t close the terminal or interrupt the process. The password may take a few minutes to appear.

Be sure to save the password. You’ll need it to sign in to the NGINX Instance Manager web interface.
