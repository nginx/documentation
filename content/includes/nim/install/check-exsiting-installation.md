The script supports only new installations. If NGINX Instance Manager is already installed, do one of the following:

- **Upgrade manually** – The script can’t perform upgrades. To update an existing installation, follow the [upgrade steps](<upgrade-link>).
- **Uninstall first** – Remove the current installation and its dependencies for a fresh start. Use the [uninstall steps](<uninstall-link>) to delete the primary components. Afterward, manually check for and remove leftover files such as repository configurations or custom settings.
