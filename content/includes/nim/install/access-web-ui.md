To access the NGINX Instance Manager web interface, open a browser and go to `https://<NIM_FQDN>`, replacing `<NIM_FQDN>` with the fully qualified domain name of your NGINX Instance Manager host.

The default administrator username is `admin`. The password was generated and displayed in the terminal during installation.

To change the password, see [Set or change user passwords]({{< ref "/nim/authentication/set-up-basic-authentication.md#set-basic-passwords-script" >}}) in the Basic Authentication topic.
