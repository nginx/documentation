The data that Instance Manager collects can be divided into two categories:

- **System metrics**: Data collected about the data plane system, such as CPU and memory usage.
- **Traffic metrics**: Data related to processed traffic from sources such as NGINX OSS, NGINX Plus, or NGINX logs.

Metrics are collected every 15 seconds and are published at 60-second intervals.

For the full list of metrics, see the [Metrics Catalog Reference]({{< relref "/nms/reference/catalogs//metrics.md" >}})
