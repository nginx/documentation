Use tools such as `curl` or [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to send requests to the NGINX Instance Manager REST API.
The API base URL is `https://<NIM-FQDN>/api/[nim|platform]/<API_VERSION>`.  
All requests require authentication. For details on authentication methods, see the [API overview]({{< ref "/nim/fundamentals/api-overview.md" >}}).
