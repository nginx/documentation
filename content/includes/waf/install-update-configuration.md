Once you have installed F5 WAF for NGINX, you must load it as a module in the main context of your NGINX configuration.

```nginx
load_module modules/ngx_http_app_protect_module.so;
```

The Enforcer address must be added at the _http_ context:

```nginx
app_protect_enforcer_address 127.0.0.1:50000;

```nginx
app_protect_enable on;
