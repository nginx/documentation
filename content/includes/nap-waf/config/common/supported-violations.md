|Violation Name | Title | Enabled Flags in Default Template | Description | Comment | 
| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- | 
|VIOL_ACCESS_INVALID| Access token does not comply with the profile requirements| Alarm | The system checks the access token in a request according to the access profile attached to the respective URL. The violation is raised when at least one of the enforced checks in the profile is not satisfied | This would trigger a Violation Rating of 5. |
|VIOL_ACCESS_MISSING| Missing Access Token | Alarm | The system checks that the request contains the access token for the respective URL according to the Access Profile. The violation is raised when that token is not found.| This would trigger a Violation Rating of 5. |
|VIOL_ACCESS_MALFORMED| Malformed Access Token | Alarm | The access token required for the URL in the request was malformed. | This would trigger a Violation Rating of 5. |
|VIOL_ASM_COOKIE_MODIFIED | Modified ASM cookie | Alarm & Block | The system checks that the request contains an ASM cookie that has not been modified or tampered with. Blocks modified requests. |  |
|VIOL_ATTACK_SIGNATURE | Attack signature detected | N/A | The system examines the HTTP message for known attacks by matching it against known attack patterns. | Determined per signature set. <br>Note: This violation cannot be configured by the user. Rather, the violation is determined by the combination of the signature sets on the policy.| 
|VIOL_BLACKLISTED_IP | IP is in the deny list | Alarm | The violation is issued when a request comes from an IP address that falls in the range of an IP address exception marked for "always blocking", that is, the deny list of IPs. | Would trigger Violation Rating of 5. | 
|VIOL_BOT_CLIENT | Bot Client Detected | Alarm & Block | The system detects automated clients, and classifies them to Bot types. |  | 
|VIOL_COOKIE_EXPIRED | Expired timestamp | Alarm | The system checks that the timestamp in the HTTP cookie is not old. An old timestamp indicates that a client session has expired. Blocks expired requests. The timestamp is extracted and validated against the current time. If the timestamp is expired and it is not an entry point, the system issues the Expired Timestamp violation. |  | 
|VIOL_COOKIE_LENGTH | Illegal cookie length | Alarm | The system checks that the request does not include a cookie header that exceeds the acceptable length specified in the security policy. | Determined by policy setting which is disabled in default template. | 
|VIOL_COOKIE_MALFORMED | Cookie not RFC-compliant | Alarm & Block | This violation occurs when HTTP cookies contain at least one of the following components:<br><ul><li>Quotation marks in the cookie name.</li><li>A space in the cookie name.</li><li>An equal sign (=) in the cookie name.</li></ul><br>  Note: A space between the cookie name and the equal sign (=), and between the equal sign (=) and cookie value is allowed.<ul><li>An equal sign (=) before the cookie name.</li><li>A carriage return (hexadecimal value of 0xd) in the cookie name.</li></ul> |  | 
|VIOL_COOKIE_MODIFIED | Modified domain cookie(s) | Alarm | The system checks that the web application cookies within the request have not been tampered, and the system checks that the request includes a web application cookie defined in the security policy. | Determined by cookie type: applied to "enforced" cookies. | 
|VIOL_DATA_GUARD | Data Guard: Information leakage detected | Alarm | The system examines responses and searches for sensitive information. | Controlled by the DG enable flag which is disabled in default template. | 
|VIOL_ENCODING | Failed to convert character | Alarm & Block | The system detects that one of the characters does not comply with the configured language encoding of the web application's security policy. | Enforced by NGINX core, reported by App Protect. | 
|VIOL_EVASION | Evasion technique detected | Alarm | This category contains a list of evasion techniques that attackers use to bypass detection. |  | 
|VIOL_FILETYPE | Illegal file type | Alarm | The system checks that the requested file type is configured as a valid file type, or not configured as an invalid file type, within the security policy. | Only for disallowed file types. | 
|VIOL_FILE_UPLOAD | Disallowed file upload content detected | Alarm | The system checks that the file upload content is not a binary executable file format. | The check must be enabled for parameters of data type file upload | 
|VIOL_FILE_UPLOAD_IN_BODY | Disallowed file upload content detected in body | Alarm | The system checks that the file upload content is not a binary executable file format. | The check must be enabled for URLs | 
|VIOL_GEOLOCATION | Disallowed Geolocations | Alarm & Block | This violation will be triggered when an attempt is made to access the web application from a restricted location. | |
|VIOL_GRAPHQL_MALFORMED | Malformed GraphQL data | Alarm & Block | This violation will be issued when the traffic expected to be GraphQL doesn't comply to the GraphQL syntax. The specifics of the syntax that will be enforced in App Protect is detailed in the enforcing section. The violation details will note the error.| In case of tolerate parser warning turned on, missing closing bracket of the JSON should not issue a violation. | 
|VIOL_GRAPHQL_FORMAT | GraphQL format data does not comply with format settings | Alarm & Block | This violation will be issued when the GraphQL profile settings are not satisfied, for example the length is too long, depth is too deep, a specific value is too long or too many batched queries. <br> The violation details will note what happened and the found length, depth or which value is too long and by what. <br> The depth violation is not learnable. The reason is that we don't know the actual depth of the query - we stop parsing at the max depth. <br> Note that the values will be used on the variables JSON part as well as the query. In a way, we can see these values as a JSON profile attributes just for the variables. | |
|VIOL_GRAPHQL_INTROSPECTION_QUERY| GraphQL introspection Query | Alarm & Block | This violation will be issued when an introspection query was seen. |  |
