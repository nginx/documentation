The following table specifies the Evasion Techniques sub-violation settings. All are supported in NGINX App Protect WAF.

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered table-sm table-responsive">}} 
|Sub-Violation | Default Template | Description | 
| ---| ---| --- | 
|%u decoding | Enabled | Performs Microsoft %u unicode decoding (%UXXXX where X is a hexadecimal digit). For example, the system turns a%u002fb to a/b. The system performs this action on URI and parameter input to evaluate if the request contains an attack. | 
|Apache whitespace | Enabled | The system detects the following characters in the URI: 9 (0x09), 11 (0x0B), 12 (0x0C), and 13 (0x0D). | 
|Bad unescape | Enabled | The system detects illegal HEX encoding. Reports unescaping errors (such as %RR). | 
|Bare byte decoding | Enabled | The system detects higher ASCII bytes (greater than 127). | 
|Directory traversals | Enabled | Ensures that directory traversal commands like ../ are not part of the URL. While requests generated by a browser should not contain directory traversal instructions, sometimes requests generated by JavaScript have them. | 
|IIS backslashes | Enabled | Normalizes backslashes (\\) to slashes (/) for further processing. | 
|IIS Unicode codepoints | Enabled | Handles the mapping of IIS specific non-ASCII codepoints. Indicates that, when a character is greater than '0x00FF', the system decodes %u according to an ANSI Latin 1 (Windows 1252) code page mapping. For example, the system turns a%u2044b to a/b. The system performs this action on URI and parameter input. | 
|Multiple decoding | Enabled: 3 | The system decodes URI and parameter values multiple times according to the number specified before the request is considered an evasion. |
