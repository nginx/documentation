A new property known as `stagingCertificationDatetime` is added to `signature-settings` section. All signatures that were created or modified in a signature update that is later than that time are in staging while all the rest are enforced and not in staging.

The `stagingCertificationDatetime` property will contain `ISO 8601` date-time format. It has effect only if `performStaging` is set to true. It is **optional** and its absence means that all signatures are placed in the staging environment, assuming the `performStaging` setting is set to true.

See below policy for more details.
