A Slow POST attack or Slow HTTP POST attack is a type of denial of service attack. The attacker sends a legitimate HTTP POST request with the header Content-Length specified. The attacker then proceeds to send this content slowly. The server establishes a connection to the client and keeps it open to receive the request that it thinks is legitimate.

The attacker sends several such requests and effectively occupies the serverâ€™s entire connection pool. As a result, it blocks the service for other legitimate users and results in a denial of service.
