The default and strict policies include and enable common signature sets, which are categorized groups of [signatures](#attack-signatures-overview) applied to the policy. However, you may wish to modify the list of signature sets and their logging and enforcement settings via the `signature-sets` array property. There are several ways to configure the enforced signature sets.

One way is by use of the `All Signatures` signature set, which is simply a predefined signature set that includes all signatures known to NGINX App Protect WAF.

In this example, the `All Signatures` set (and therefore the signatures included within) are configured to be enforced and logged respectively, by setting their `block` and `alarm` properties:

```json
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "attack_sigs",
        "template": { "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE" },
        "applicationLanguage": "utf-8",
        "enforcementMode": "blocking",
        "signature-sets": [
            {
                 "name": "All Signatures",
                 "block": true,
                 "alarm": true
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example, only high accuracy signatures are configured to be enforced, but SQL Injection signatures are detected and reported:

```json
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "attack_sigs",
        "template": {
            "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE"
        },
        "applicationLanguage": "utf-8",
        "enforcementMode": "blocking",
        "signature-sets": [
            {
                "name": "High Accuracy Signatures",
                "block": true,
                "alarm": true
            },
            {
                "name": "SQL Injection Signatures",
                "block": false,
                "alarm": true
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Since the "All Signatures" set is not included in the default policy, turning OFF both alarm and block has no effect because all the other sets with alarm turned ON (and high accuracy signatures with block enabled) are still in place and a signature that is a member of multiple sets behaves in accordance with the strict settings of all sets it belongs to. The only way to remove signature sets is to remove or disable sets that are part of the [default policy](#signature-sets-in-default-policy).

For example, in the below default policy, even though All Signature's Alarm/Block settings are set to false, we cannot ignore all attack signatures enforcement as some of the signature sets will be enabled in their strict policy. If the end users want to remove a specific signature set then they must explicitly mention it under the [strict policy](#the-strict-policy).

```json
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "signatures_block",
        "template": {
            "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE"
        },
        "applicationLanguage": "utf-8",
        "caseInsensitive": false,
        "enforcementMode": "blocking",
        "signature-sets": [
            {
                "name": "Generic Detection Signatures (High/Medium Accuracy)",
                "block": false,
                "alarm": false
            },
            {
                "name": "All Signatures",
                "block": false,
                "alarm": false
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

A signature may belong to more than one set in the policy. Its behavior is determined by the most severe action across all the sets that contain it. In the above example, a high accuracy SQL injection signature will both alarm and block, because the `High Accuracy Signatures` set is blocking and both sets trigger alarm.

The default policy already includes many signature sets, most of which are determined by the attack type these signatures protect from, for example `Cross-Site Scripting Signatures` or `SQL Injection Signatures`. See [the full list](#signature-sets-in-default-policy) above. In some cases you may want to exclude individual signatures.

In this example, signature ID 200001834 is excluded from enforcement:

```json
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "signature_exclude",
        "template": { "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE" },
        "applicationLanguage": "utf-8",
        "enforcementMode": "blocking",
        "signature-sets": [
            {
                 "name": "All Signatures",
                 "block": true,
                 "alarm": true
            }
        ],
        "signatures": [
            {
                 "signatureId": 200001834,
                 "enabled": false
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Another way to exclude signature ID 200001834 is by using the `modifications` section instead of the `signatures` section used in the example above:

```json
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "signature_modification_entitytype",
        "template": { "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE" },
        "applicationLanguage": "utf-8",
        "enforcementMode": "blocking",
        "signature-sets": [
            {
                 "name": "All Signatures",
                 "block": true,
                 "alarm": true
            }
        ]
    },
    "modifications": [
        {
            "entityChanges": {
                "enabled": false
            },
            "entity": {
                "signatureId": 200001834
            },
            "entityType": "signature",
            "action": "add-or-update"
        }
    ]
}
```

To exclude multiple attack signatures, each signature ID needs to be added as a separate entity under the `modifications` list:

```json
{
    "modifications": [
        {
            "entityChanges": {
                "enabled": false
            },
            "entity": {
                "signatureId": 200001834
            },
            "entityType": "signature",
            "action": "add-or-update"
        },
        {
            "entityChanges": {
                "enabled": false
            },
            "entity": {
                "signatureId": 200004461
            },
            "entityType": "signature",
            "action": "add-or-update"
        }
    ]
}
```

In the above examples, the signatures were disabled for all the requests that are inspected by the respective policy. You can also exclude signatures for specific URLs or parameters, while still enable them for the other URLs and parameters. See the sections on [User-Defined URLs](#user-defined-urls) and [User-Defined Parameters](#user-defined-parameters) for details.

In some cases, you may want to remove a whole signature set that was included in the default policy. For example, suppose your protected application does not use XML and hence is not exposed to XPath injection. You would like to remove the set `XPath Injection Signatures`. There are two ways to do that. The first is to set the `alarm` and `block` flags to `false` for this signature set overriding the settings in the base template:

```json
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "no_xpath_policy",
        "template": { "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE" },
        "signature-sets": [
            {
                 "name": "XPath Injection Signatures",
                 "block": false,
                 "alarm": false
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The second way is to remove this set totally from the policy using the `$action` meta-property.

```json
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "no_xpath_policy",
        "template": { "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE" },
        "signature-sets": [
            {
                 "name": "XPath Injection Signatures",
                 "$action": "delete"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Although the two methods are functionally equivalent, the second one is preferable for performance reasons.


#### Server Technologies

Another way to configure attack signature sets is by applying server technologies. Server technologies applies sets of signatures that would be relevant to attacks targeted to a specific OS, application, or server type. The Server technologies are represented in attack signatures as `systems` using the same name, for example `SharePoint`. Note, however, that the overlap between Server technologies and signature systems is not complete: there are server technologies that cannot be represented as signature systems, and also a few generic signature systems that are not represented as server technologies. The exact details will follow in the sections just below. Server technologies that are not signature systems will not bring in new signatures when added to the policy. However, associating them with the policy still has declarational value, and in one of the future signature updates they may be associated with new signatures.

In this example, we enable the attack signature violation, and enabled the **Apache/NCSA HTTP Server** server technology, which in turn enables attack signatures specific to this type of technology. We also enabled signatures with minimum accuracy of low. This would include low, medium, and high accuracy attack signatures.

```json
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "policy_name",
        "template": { "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE" },
        "applicationLanguage": "utf-8",
        "enforcementMode": "blocking",
        "signature-settings": {
            "minimumAccuracyForAutoAddedSignatures": "low"
        },
        "server-technologies": [
            { "serverTechnologyName": "Apache/NCSA HTTP Server" }
        ]
    }
}
```

##### Generic Signature Systems

These signature systems are generic and do not represent a particular technology, therefore do not have a server technology counterpart. Yet, there are signatures associated with them. The `Generic Detection Signatures` factory signature set includes most of these signatures. You can define your own signature sets using one or more of those systems.

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered table-sm table-responsive">}}
|System Name | Description |
| ---| --- |
|Other Web Server | Web Servers that are not covered by any of the specific server technologies |
|System Independent | Used to denote signatures that apply to any server technology |
|Various Systems | Server-side systems not covered by any of the existing server technologies or the other systems here |
|Generic Database | Database systems that are not covered by any of the specific server technologies |
{{</bootstrap-table>}}


#### Threat Campaigns

Threat Campaigns is a threat intelligence feature included in an NGINX App Protect WAF subscription. The feature includes frequent update feeds containing contextual information about active attack campaigns currently being observed by F5 Threat Labs that NGINX App Protect WAF can provide protection against. As an example, without threat campaign updates NGINX App Protect WAF (and any WAF in general) may detect an attack pattern in a web application form parameter, but it cannot correlate the singular attack incident as part of a more extensive and sophisticated threat campaign. Threat Campaigns' contextual information is very specific to current attack campaigns, allowing false positives to be virtually non-existent.

Just like attack signatures, the Threat Campaign patterns, i.e. `app-protect-attack-signatures` and `app-protect-threat-campaigns` are installed as a dependency chain of our main package `app-protect`. Then, these two package dependencies should be updated periodically to get the latest security updates. Due to the highly dynamic nature of threat campaigns the updates are issued far more frequently than the attack signatures. You need to install those updates close to the time they are issued in order to get the most effective protection.

The default policy enables the mechanism with all available Threat Campaigns and blocks when detecting one. Since the risk of false positive is very low, you do not need to enable or disable specific Threat Campaigns. Rather, you can disable the whole mechanism or decide to only alarm rather than block. You can do that by modifying the properties of the Threat Campaign Violation - `VIOL_THREAT_CAMPAIGN`.

In this example we disable both alarm and blocking.

 ```json
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "policy_name",
        "template": { "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE" },
        "applicationLanguage": "utf-8",
        "enforcementMode": "blocking",
        "blocking-settings": {
            "violations": [
                {
                    "name": "VIOL_THREAT_CAMPAIGN",
                    "alarm": false,
                    "block": false
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

```

#### Data Guard - Blocking

Data Guard is a security feature that can be used to prevent the leakage of sensitive information from an application. This could be credit card numbers (CCN) or Social Security numbers (SSN) or custom patterns. Once this feature is enabled, sensitive data is either blocked or masked, depending on the configuration.

In this example, we enable the data guard violation in blocking mode. In the detailed configuration, we enable enforcement of data guard and specify which items are being protected against information leakage. Note that if blocking is enabled, data masking will have no effect in this case.

```json
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "dataguard_blocking",
        "template": { "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE" },

#### Data Guard - Masking

Masking is used when we do not want to block the page entirely but want to mask all sensitive data in the response.

In this example, we enable data guard in alarm mode. In the detailed configuration, we enable enforcement of data guard and specify which items are being protected against information leakage.

```json
{
    "policy": {
        "name": "nginx_default_policy",
        "template": { "name": "POLICY_TEMPLATE_NGINX_BASE" },
        "applicationLanguage": "utf-8",
        "enforcementMode": "blocking",
        "blocking-settings": {
            "violations": [
                {
                    "name": "VIOL_DATA_GUARD",
                    "alarm": true,
                    "block": false
                }
            ]
        },
        "data-guard": {
            "enabled": true,
            "maskData": true,
