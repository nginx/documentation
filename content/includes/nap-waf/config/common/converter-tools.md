NGINX App Protect WAF includes a number of tools that can be used to facilitate the process of porting existing resources or configuration files from the BIG-IP for use in the NGINX App Protect WAF environment. Note that these tools are available in the compiler package, and do not require a full installation of NGINX App Protect WAF or NGINX Plus.
