To install the NGINX Management Suite, you need the following:

- A trial or paid subscription for NGINX Management Suite. [Sign up for NGINX Management Suite at MyF5](https://account.f5.com/myf5).

- A Linux instance for hosting the NGINX Management Suite and modules.

- An installed version of NGINX Plus or NGINX OSS.

- Ensure any network firewall is open for access from external systems. NGINX Management Suite uses port `443` for both the gRPC and API/web interfaces.

- An [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) installation. We strongly recommend OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later.
