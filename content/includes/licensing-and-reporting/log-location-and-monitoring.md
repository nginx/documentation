Monitor the [NGINX error log](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#error_log), usually at `/var/log/nginx/error.log`, to identify subscription issues early. The log records problems such as failed usage reports or licenses that are about to expire. Check it regularly to avoid downtime and stay compliant.

You can also use the [license API endpoint](https://demo.nginx.com/api/9/license) to check license status programmatically. For details, see the [ngx_http_api_module docs](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html#def_nginx_license_object).

Examples of log entries:

- **Failed usage reports:**

  ``` text
  [error] 36387#36387: server returned 500 for <fqdn>:<port> during usage report
  [error] 36528#36528: <fqdn>:<port> could not be resolved (host not found) during usage report
  [error] 36619#36619: connect() failed (111: Connection refused) for <fqdn>:<port> during usage report
  [error] 38888#88: server returned 401 for <ip_address>:443 during usage report
  ```

- **License nearing expiration:**

  ``` text
  [warn] license will expire in 14 days
  ```

- **License expired:**

  ``` text
  [alert] license expiry; grace period will end in 89 days
  [emerg] license expired
  ```

NGINX Plus stops processing traffic if the license has been expired for more than 90 days.
