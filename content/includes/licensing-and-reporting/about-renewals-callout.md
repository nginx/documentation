Starting in NGINX Plus R35, renewed JWT licenses are [applied automatically](#automatic-renewal) if license reporting is enabled.  
Manual deployment is still required for the initial license, or in environments where auto-renewal is not available (such as disconnected networks).  

If you’re running a release earlier than R35, you’ll need to [update the license manually](#update-jwt) whenever your subscription renews.
