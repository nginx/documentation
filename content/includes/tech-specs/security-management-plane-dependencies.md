| Security Monitoring | Instance Manager |
|---------------------|------------------|
| 1.4.0               | 2.10.0   /* does this need to be updated for 2.10.1? */         |
| 1.3.0               | 2.9.0            |
| 1.2.0               | 2.8.0            |
| 1.1.0               | 2.7.0            |
| 1.0.0               | 2.6.0            |
{{</bootstrap-table>}}

{{<important>}}The Security Monitoring module installation does not automatically install or upgrade Instance Manager. You'll need to manually install Instance Manager, or upgrade it to a version supported for use with Security Monitoring.{{</important>}}
