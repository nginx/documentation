- {{% icon-resolved %}} **Instance Manager vulnerability CVE-2023-1550**

  NGINX Agent inserts sensitive information into a log file ([CVE-2023-1550](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1550)). An authenticated attacker with local access to read NGINX Agent log files may gain access to private keys. This issue is exposed only when the non-default trace-level logging is enabled.

  NGINX Agent is included with NGINX Instance Manager, and used in conjunction with API Connectivity Manager and the Security Monitoring module.

  This issue has been classified as [CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html).

  **Mitigation**
  
  - Avoid configuring trace-level logging in the NGINX Agent configuration file. For more information, refer to the [Configuring the NGINX Agent]({{< relref "nginx-agent/install-nginx-agent.md#configuring-the-nginx-agent ">}}) section of NGINX Management Suite documentation. If trace-level logging is required, ensure only trusted users have access to the log files.

  **Fixed in**

  - NGINX Agent 2.23.3
  - Instance Manager 2.9.0

  For more information, refer to the MyF5 article [K000133135](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000133135).
