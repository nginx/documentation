It's easy to track and report NGINX Plus usage with NGINX Management Suite Instance Manager. You may be expected to report this information to F5 if you're enrolled in a commercial program, such as the [F5 Flex Consumption Program](https://www.f5.com/products/get-f5/flex-consumption-program).

Start by installing NGINX Instance Manager on a dedicated host. Then configure your NGINX deployments for reporting. After your deployments have registered with Instance Manager, you can view and track your usage over time from the web interface. If you [apply a JSON Web Token]({{< relref "nms/installation/add-license.md#apply-jwt-license" >}}) as a license for Instance Manager, you can send usage reports to F5 on a regular basis or on-demand when needed.
