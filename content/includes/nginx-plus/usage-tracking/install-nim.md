{{<note>}}You don't need to purchase a license for NGINX Management Suite to track your NGINX product usage.{{</note>}}

To be able to report on your [NGINX Plus]({{< relref "nginx/" >}}) installations, you first need to install [NGINX Instance Manager]({{< relref "nms/nim/" >}}) on a dedicated host. You have two options for this: installing on a Virtual Machine or Bare Metal server, or deploying on a Kubernetes cluster. Instructions for both methods are provided below:

#### Virtual Machine or Bare Metal

- [Prerequisites]({{< relref "nms/installation/vm-bare-metal/prerequisites.md" >}})
- [Install NGINX Instance Manager]({{< relref "nms/installation/vm-bare-metal/install-nim.md" >}})

#### Kubernetes

- [Deploy Instance Manager on Kubernetes]({{< relref "nms/installation/kubernetes/deploy-instance-manager.md" >}})
