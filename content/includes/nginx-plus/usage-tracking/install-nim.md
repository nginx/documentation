{{<note>}}A separate license for NGINX Instance Manager is not required to track your NGINX product usage.{{</note>}}

To start reporting on your [NGINX Plus]({{< relref "nginx/" >}}) installations, you'll first need to install [NGINX Instance Manager]({{< relref "nim/" >}}) on a dedicated host. You can choose between two installation options: either on a virtual machine or bare metal server, or by deploying on a Kubernetes cluster. Instructions for both methods are below:

#### Virtual Machine or Bare Metal

- [Prerequisites]({{< relref "/nim/deploy/vm-bare-metal/install.md" >}})
- [Install NGINX Instance Manager]({{< relref "/nim/deploy/vm-bare-metal/install.md" >}})

#### Kubernetes

- [Deploy Instance Manager on Kubernetes]({{< relref "/nim/deploy/kubernetes/deploy-using-helm.md" >}})
