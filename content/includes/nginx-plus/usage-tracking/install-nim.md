{{< call-out "note" >}}A separate license for NGINX Instance Manager is not required to track your NGINX product usage.{{< /call-out >}}

To start reporting on your [NGINX Plus]({{< ref "nginx/" >}}) installations, you'll first need to install [NGINX Instance Manager]({{< ref "nim/" >}}) on a dedicated host. You can choose between two installation options: either on a virtual machine or bare metal server, or by deploying on a Kubernetes cluster. Instructions for both methods are below:

#### Virtual Machine or Bare Metal

- [Prerequisites]({{< ref "/nim/install/vm-bare-metal/install-with-bash-script-online.md" >}})
- [Install NGINX Instance Manager]({{< ref "/nim/install/vm-bare-metal/install-with-bash-script-online.md" >}})

#### Kubernetes

- [Deploy Instance Manager on Kubernetes]({{< ref "nim/install/kubernetes/deploy-using-helm.md" >}})
