After you've set up both NGINX Instance Manager on a dedicated host and NGINX Agent on your NGINX Plus instances, you can view the number of instances that have successfully registered with Instance Manager.

1. {{< include "nim/webui-nim-login.md" >}}
2. On the left menu, select **NGINX Plus**.
3. (Optional) To download a list of your registered NGINX Plus instances, select **Export**. Keep in mind that the exported list is limited to the current page count.
