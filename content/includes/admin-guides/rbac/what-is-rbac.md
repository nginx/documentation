RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a security framework that provides access control based on roles assigned to users. It defines the roles and responsibilities of users within the system and restricts access to resources according to the userâ€™s role. It ensures only authorized users have access to specific resources and prevents unauthorized access.
