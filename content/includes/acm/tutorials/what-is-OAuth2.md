The _OAuth2 Authorization Framework_ [[RFC-6749]](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749) grants third-party applications limited access to an HTTP service either by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service or granting the third-party application access on its own behalf.

OAuth2 is an authorization protocol, not an authentication protocol. As such, OAuth2 grants access to a set of resources, for example, internal APIs or user data.
