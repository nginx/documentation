When installing API Connectivity Manager, you may need a newer version of NGINX Management Suite. The installation process will notify you of any version requirements before installing API Connectivity Manager and any dependent packages, including NGINX Management Suite. You may cancel the installation process if a backup of the NGINX Management Suite is needed before upgrading.

3. Enable the API Connectivity Manager services:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable nms-acm
    ```

4. Restart the API Connectivity Manager services:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nms-acm
    ```

    NGINX Management Suite components started this way run by default as the non-root `nms` user inside the `nms` group, both of which are created during installation.

    ```bash
    ps aufx | grep nms
    ```
