To license App Delivery Manager, use the trial license provided by your sales team. **Do not** use a trial license downloaded from [MyF5](https://my.f5.com), as this may lead to errors.

Please note that trials cannot be combined. For example, you cannot use a trial for Instance Manager and add a trial for App Delivery Manager. After a trial expires, it cannot be reused on the same instance.
