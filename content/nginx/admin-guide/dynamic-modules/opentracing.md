description: Instrument NGINX with OpenTracing-compliant requests for a range of distributed
  tracing services, such as Zipkin, Jaeger and Datadog. Note that the opentracing
  module provides the framework for recording traces; you will also need to install
  a service-specific tracing module.  This module (“tracer”) pushes traces to the
  collector and analyser provided by that service.
