## Prerequisites

### Install NGINX Instance Manager on a dedicated host {#install-instance-manager}

{{< include "nginx-plus/usage-tracking/install-nim.md" >}}


## View your NGINX Plus and NGINX App Protect Inventory

After you've installed NGINX Instance Manager, the next step involves configuring your NGINX Plus data plane to report back. This can be done in several ways. In NGINX Plus Release 31, native usage reporting is enabled by default. If you are using an earlier version of NGINX Plus, you can install NGINX Agent on each instance or you can set up HTTP Health Checks, which don't require additional installations. All methods enable your instances to communicate with Instance Manager.

### Set up instance reporting for NGINX Plus {#set-up-reporting}

Select the tab that matches your preferred method for setting up reporting:

- Configure native usage reporting (since NGINX Plus <a href="../../../releases/#r31">Release 31</a>)
- Install NGINX Agent 
- Configure HTTP Health Check for NGINX Plus without NGINX Agent

## View your NGINX Ingress Controller instances and nodes

You can set up your Kubernetes-based NGINX Plus products, including [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-ingress-controller/) and [Connectivity Stack for Kubernetes](https://www.nginx.com/solutions/kubernetes/), to report usage data to NGINX Instance Manager.

### Set up usage reporting for NGINX Ingress Controller

Follow the instructions in the [Enabling Usage Reporting](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/usage-reporting/) guide to enable usage reporting for NGINX Ingress Controller.
