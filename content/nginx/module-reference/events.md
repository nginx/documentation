nginx supports a variety of connection processing methods.
The availability of a particular method depends on the platform used.
On platforms that support several methods nginx will normally
select the most efficient method automatically.
However, if needed, a connection processing method can be selected
explicitly with the
[use]({{< relref "ngx_core_module#use" >}}) directive.

The following connection processing methods are supported:

- `select`Â â€” standard method.
The supporting module is built automatically on platforms that lack
more efficient methods.
The `--with-select_module` and
`--without-select_module` configuration parameters
can be used to forcibly enable or disable the build of this module.

- `poll`Â â€” standard method.
The supporting module is built automatically on platforms that lack
more efficient methods.
The `--with-poll_module` and
`--without-poll_module` configuration parameters
can be used to forcibly enable or disable the build of this module.

- `kqueue`Â â€” efficient method used on
FreeBSD 4.1+, OpenBSD 2.9+, NetBSD 2.0, and macOS.

- `epoll`Â â€” efficient method used on
Linux 2.6+.

> The `EPOLLRDHUP` (Linux 2.6.17, glibc 2.8) and `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` (Linux 4.5, glibc 2.24) flags are supported since 1.11.3.


> Some older distributions like SuSEÂ 8.2 provide patches that add epoll support to 2.4 kernels.


- `/dev/poll`Â â€” efficient method used on
Solaris 7 11/99+, HP/UX 11.22+ (eventport), IRIX 6.5.15+,
and Tru64 UNIX 5.1A+.

- `eventport`Â â€” event ports, method
used on Solaris 10+ (due to known issues,
it is recommended using the `/dev/poll` method instead).
