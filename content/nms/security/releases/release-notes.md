### Security Updates{#1-3-0-security-updates}

{{< important >}}
For the protection of our customers, NGINX doesnâ€™t disclose security issues until an investigation has occurred and a fix is available.
{{< /important >}}

This release includes the following security updates:

- {{% icon-resolved %}} **Instance Manager vulnerability CVE-2023-1550**<a name="1-3-0-security-updates-Instance-Manager-vulnerability-CVE-2023-1550"></a>

  NGINX Agent inserts sensitive information into a log file ([CVE-2023-1550](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1550)). An authenticated attacker with local access to read NGINX Agent log files may gain access to private keys. This issue is exposed only when the non-default trace-level logging is enabled.

  NGINX Agent is included with NGINX Instance Manager, and used in conjunction with API Connectivity Manager and the Security Monitoring module.

  This issue has been classified as [CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html).

#### Mitigation

- Avoid configuring trace-level logging in the NGINX Agent configuration file. For more information, refer to the [Configuring the NGINX Agent]({{< relref "/nms/nginx-agent/install-nginx-agent.md#configuring-the-nginx-agent ">}}) section of NGINX Management Suite documentation. If trace-level logging is required, ensure only trusted users have access to the log files.

#### Fixed in

- NGINX Agent 2.23.3
- Instance Manager 2.9.0

For more information, refer to the MyF5 article [K000133135](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000133135).


### Changes in Default Behavior{#1-3-0-changes-in-behavior}

  The Security Monitoring module now displays the message "Upstream unavailable" when the NGINX Management Suite server is not running, instead of the previous message "Oops something went wrong."

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Single quotes are automatically escaped in filtered values**<a name="1-3-0-changes-in-behavior-Single-quotes-are-automatically-escaped-in-filtered-values"></a>

  Single quotes in filtered values are automatically escaped to ensure that the data is parsed correctly.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Removal of Total Requests count**<a name="1-1-0-changes-in-behavior-Removal-of-Total-Requests-count"></a>

  The Total Requests count was removed from the Security Monitoring dashboards, to avoid customer confusion, as the value didn't convey different configuration scenarios for NGINX App Protect on NGINX instances.

- {{% icon-feature %}} **Removal of WAF PASSED requests count**<a name="1-1-0-changes-in-behavior-Removal-of-WAF-PASSED-requests-count"></a>

  The count of WAF `PASSED` requests was removed from the Security Monitoring dashboards to avoid customer confusion, as it counted only requests with violations and not all requests filtered by NGINX App Protect WAF.
