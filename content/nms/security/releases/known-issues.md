### {{% icon-resolved %}} The API Connectivity Manager module won't load if the Security Monitoring module is enabled {#44433}

{{<bootstrap-table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}

| Issue ID       | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| 44433 | Fixed in Instance Manager 2.8.0   |

{{</bootstrap-table>}}
#### Description
If you have Instance Manager 2.7 or earlier installed and attempt to enable both the API Connectivity Manager and Security Monitoring modules on the same NGINX Management Suite management plane, the API Connectivity Manager module will not load because of incompatibility issues with the Security Monitoring module.

#### Workaround

Before enabling the API Connectivity Manager and Security Monitoring modules, ensure that your Instance Manager is upgraded to version 2.8 or later. Be sure to read the release notes for each module carefully, as they may contain important information about version dependencies.

To see which version of Instance Manager you have installed, run the following command:

- CentOS, RHEL, RPM-based:

   ```bash
   yum info nms-instance-manager
   ```

- Debian, Ubuntu, Deb-based:

   ```bash
   dpkg -s nms-instance-manager
   ```
