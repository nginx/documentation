The steps in this guide refer to the <a href="https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-management-suite" target="_blank">Ansible NGINX Management Suite Role project on GitHub.</a> <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square" style="color:#009639;"></i>
{{</call-out>}}


Use the NGINX Management Suite Ansible role to install NGINX Management Suite, which includes the following modules:

- [Instance Manager]({{< relref "/nms/about.md#instance-manager" >}})
- [API Connectivity Manager]({{< relref "/nms/about.md#api-connectivity-manager" >}})
- [Application Delivery Manager]({{< relref "/nms/about.md#app-delivery-manager" >}})
- [Security Monitoring]({{< relref "/nms/about.md#security-monitoring" >}})

Additionally, the ansible role installs NGINX (OSS or Plus) and [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com), both prerequisites for NGINX Management Suite.

To get started, you'll need:

- An NGINX repository certificate and key. For instructions on how to download them, click [here]({{< relref "/nms/installation/vm-bare-metal/prerequisites.md#download-cert-key" >}}).
- A host capable of running Ansible.
