## Getting Started

1. Install the Ansible role by using an Ansible Galaxy requirements file. Follow the installation steps [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-management-suite#installation).

2. Next, run the Ansible playbook. Create a file named `nms-playbook.yml` (or any other name) with contents similar to the following example:

    ``` yaml
    - hosts: nms
      become: yes
      vars:
        nginx_license:
          certificate: ./nginx-repo.crt
          key: ./nginx-repo.key
        nms_setup: install
        nms_modules:
          - name: acm
          - name: adm
          - name: sm
      collections:
        - nginxinc.nginx_core
      roles:
        - nginxinc.nginx_management_suite
    ```

3. Create an [Ansible hosts file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html) containing the hosts you want in the group listed in your playbook.

4. Run the playbook:

    ``` bash
    ansible-playbook -i <path-to-your-hostfile> nms-playbook.yml
    ```
