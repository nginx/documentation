## Overview

Single sign-on (SSO) can be enabled on the Developer Portal to secure access to the portal and to allow authenticated API consumers to manage resource credentials. Logged-in consumers can then self-manage resource credentials for the APIs.

Single sign-on is enabled by applying an OpenID Connect (OIDC) policy on the Developer Portal. The OIDC policy sets up the portal proxy to act as a relying party to authenticate users with the OIDC provider.

### Before You Begin

Complete the following prerequisites before proceeding with this guide:

- API Connectivity Manager is installed, licensed, and running. See [API Connectivity Manager Install Guide]({{< relref "/nms/installation/vm-bare-metal/_index.md" >}}).
- You have one or more Environments with [API Gateways]({{< relref "/nms/acm/getting-started/add-api-gateway" >}}) or [Developer Portals]({{< relref "/nms/acm/getting-started/add-devportal" >}}).

### Terminology

The following terminology is used in this topic:

### Supported OIDC Identity Providers

API Connectivity Manager supports all of the same identity providers as NGINX Plus. The following guides describe how to configure NGINX Plus for these identity providers, and outline where to find the information you'll need to configure them for OIDC.

- [Auth0](/nginx/deployment-guides/single-sign-on/auth0/)
- [Amazon Cognito](/nginx/deployment-guides/single-sign-on/cognito)
- [Keycloak](/nginx/deployment-guides/single-sign-on/keycloak)
- [Microsoft Active Directory FS](/nginx/deployment-guides/single-sign-on/active-directory-federation-services)
- [Okta](/nginx/deployment-guides/single-sign-on/okta)
- [OneLogin](/nginx/deployment-guides/single-sign-on/onelogin)
- [Ping Identity](/nginx/deployment-guides/single-sign-on/ping-identity)

## Set up OIDC Policy

{{< include "acm/how-to/setup-oidc.md" >}}

Single sign-on (SSO) is enabled on the Developer Portal after configuring the OIDC policy. Application developers can log in through the configured centralized identity provider (IDP). After a successful login, they can create resource credentials for the available APIs.

## Known Limitation with the policy

The OIDC policy does not yet support custom DNS for resolution. Only external DNS resolution is supported.
