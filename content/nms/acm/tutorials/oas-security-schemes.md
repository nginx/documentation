## Overview

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) allows you to specify authentication and authorization requirements, or security schemes, for your APIs, ensuring that only authorized users or applications can access them. These security schemes are applied globally, meaning they are enforced for all APIs within the OAS.

{{<note>}}When configuring security schemes, keep in mind that path-level security requirements will not be applied and are ignored.{{</note>}}

Listed below are the OAS security schemes that API Connectivity Manager supports.

## Basic Authentication Security Scheme

Basic Authentication is a security scheme that is commonly used to authenticate HTTP requests. The request contains a header field in the form of `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where `<credentials>` is the Base64-encoded username and password joined by a single colon.

With Basic Authentication, API owners can restrict access to their APIs by requiring usernames and passwords; API access is granted only after a username and password are validated.

{{<call-out "important" "Security Consideration" >}}We recommend using Basic Authentication only over encrypted channels such as HTTPS in order to minimize security risks.{{</call-out>}}

|-------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| `type`                  | `string`  | True   | `http` | The type of the security scheme.       | `N/A`  |
| `description`         | `string`   | False | Of type `string` | A short description for the security scheme. CommonMark syntax can be used for rich text representation.      | `N/A`    |

### Configure Basic Authentication Scheme

To configure a basic authentication scheme, take the following steps:

1. Create an API spec with the basic security scheme configured. In the following example, take a look at how `ExampleBasicAuth` is configured in `component.securitySchemes`.

   ```bash
   POST https://{{NMS-FQDN}}/api/acm/v1/services/workspaces/{{proxyworkspacename}}/api-docs
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>Example POST/PUT JSON request: Create Basic Authentication API Spec</summary>

   {{< include "acm/tutorials/security-scheme-json-blobs/basic-security-apispec.md" >}}

   </details>


2. Create a proxy with `specRef` referencing the spec from step 1. Since the referenced spec uses Basic Authentication, you need to include the necessary basic authentication credentials within the body of the POST/PUT request.

   ```bash
   POST https://{{NMS-FQDN}}/api/acm/v1/services/workspaces/{{proxyworkspacename}}/proxies
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>Example POST/PUT JSON request: Create Proxy referencing OAS spec with Basic Authentication scheme</summary>

   {{< include "acm/tutorials/security-scheme-json-blobs/basic-auth-post-proxy.md" >}}

   </details>

   Verify the GET request for the proxy. In the JSON response, you should see `policies.basic-authn` configured in the `proxyConfig` section.

   ```bash
   GET https://{{NMS-FQDN}}/api/acm/v1/services/workspaces/{{proxyworkspacename}}/proxies/petstore-proxy?hostname={{environmentHostname}}&version=v1&includes=sensitivedata
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>Example GET JSON response: Proxy with basic-authn policy configured</summary>

   {{< include "acm/tutorials/security-scheme-json-blobs/basic-auth-get-proxy.md" >}}

   </details>

3. Pass traffic to the endpoints. The following example sends a request through a proxy to the Pet Store server, using Basic Authentication. A successful request will return a `200` status response.

   ```bash
   curl -X GET -u user1:secret -H "Content-Type: application/json"  http://54.188.248.124/api/v3/pet/4

   {"id":4,"category":{"id":1,"name":"{{$$randomFirstName}}"},"name":"Steve","photoUrls":["http://placeimg.com/640/480/cats"],"tags":[{"id":0,"name":"string"}],"status":"available"}
   ```

   In contrast, if the request lacks proper authentication, the response is "Unauthorized" with a status code of `401`

   ```bash
   curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://54.188.248.124/v1/pet

   {
       "message": "Unauthorized",
       "status": "401"
   }
   ```

## API Key Authentication Security Scheme

The API Key Authentication security scheme uses a unique API key to authenticate requests. The API key is usually a long, randomly generated string provided to the client by the API owner. To access the API, the client must include this key as a query parameter or in the request header. The API owner can use this key to identify the client and authorize access to the API.

### Configure API Key Authentication Scheme

To configure the API Key Authentication security scheme, take the following steps:

1. Create an API spec with the `apiKey` security scheme configured. In the following example, take a look at how `ExampleApiKeyAuth` is configured in `component.securitySchemes`. 

   ```bash
   POST https://{{NMS-FQDN}}/api/acm/v1/services/workspaces/{{proxyworkspacename}}/api-docs
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>Example POST/PUT JSON request: Create API Key Authentication API Spec</summary>

   {{< include "acm/tutorials/security-scheme-json-blobs/apikey-auth-spec.md" >}}

   </details>

2. Create a proxy with `specRef` referencing the spec from step 1. See the following example for how your proxy request body should look with `apikey-authn` configured on the policy. 

   Note, since the referenced spec uses the API Key Authentication security scheme, you need to include the required API key within the POST/PUT request body.

   ```bash
   POST https://{{NMS-FQDN}}/api/acm/v1/services/workspaces/{{proxyworkspacename}}/proxies
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>Example POST/PUT JSON request: Create Proxy referencing OAS spec with API Key Authentication scheme</summary>

   {{< include "acm/tutorials/security-scheme-json-blobs/apikey-auth-post-proxy.md" >}}

   </details>

   Verify the GET request for the proxy. In the JSON response, you should see `policies.apikey-authn` in the `proxyConfig` section.

   ```bash
   GET https://{{NMS-FQDN}}/api/acm/v1/services/workspaces/{{proxyworkspacename}}/proxies/petstore-proxy?hostname={{environmentHostname}}&version=v1&includes=sensitivedata
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>Example GET JSON response: Proxy with apikey-authn policy configured</summary>

   {{< include "acm/tutorials/security-scheme-json-blobs/apikey-auth-get-proxy.md" >}}

   </details>

   ```bash
   curl -X GET -H "apiKey:testapikey1234" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  http://54.188.248.124/api/v3/pet/4
   {"id":4,"category":{"id":1,"name":"{{$$randomFirstName}}"},"name":"Steve","photoUrls":["http://placeimg.com/640/480/cats"],"tags":[{"id":0,"name":"string"}],"status":"available"}
   ```

   If the request lacks proper authentication, the response is "Unauthorized" with a status code of `401`

   ```bash
   curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://54.188.248.124/v1/pet
   {
       "message": "Unauthorized",
       "status": "401"
   }
   ```
