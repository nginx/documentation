## 4.0.0

May 18, 2023

### What's New

This is the initial release of the Application Delivery Manager (ADM).  It is designed to replace the ADC Controller 3.X series. This version introduces the following features:

- Streamlined APIs
- Templates to control the generation of the NGINX configuration.
- Template use cases that can enhance the APIs and are fully customizerable.  Common use cases, such as caching, health monitoring, and programmability, will be shipped with the initial release of the product.
