Welcome to the NGINX Writing Style Guide! 

This style guide is intended to give guidance to any possible contributors, whether they are internal or external.

The details included are to guide contributors towards communicating clearly and consistently across NGINX's documentation.

The scope of writing this style guide covers includes [end-user documentation](/), API documentation, configuration files, and in-product messages.

## General guidance

We follow American English spelling and conventions. For spelling reference, use the [American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/).

When the NGINX style guide does not cover a style, refer next to the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), then the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).

If a style is unclear, ensure it is consistent with other writing for the topic or type of document, or ask about it as part of a pull request or issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nginx/documentation).

To get involved with NGINX documentation, read the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/nginx/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
