## F5 WAF for NGINX 4.7

December 19, 2023

In this release, F5 WAF for NGINX supports NGINX Plus R31.

### New Features

- RHEL 9+ Support

### Supported Packages

#### App Protect

##### Alpine 3.16

- app-protect-31.4.641.0-r1.apk

##### Alpine 3.17

- app-protect-31.4.641.0-r1.apk

##### CentOS 7.4+ / RHEL 7.4+ / Amazon Linux 2

- app-protect-31+4.641.0-1.el7.ngx.x86_64.rpm

##### Debian 11

- app-protect_31+4.641.0-1~bullseye_amd64.deb

##### Oracle Linux 8.1+

- app-protect-31+4.641.0-1.el8.ngx.x86_64.rpm

##### RHEL 8.1+

- app-protect-31+4.641.0-1.el8.ngx.x86_64.rpm

##### RHEL 9+

- app-protect-31+4.641.0-1.el9.ngx.x86_64.rpm

##### Ubuntu 20.04

- app-protect_31+4.641.0-1~focal_amd64.deb

##### Ubuntu 22.04

- app-protect_31+4.641.0-1~jammy_amd64.deb

#### NGINX Plus

- NGINX Plus R31

### Resolved Issues

- 9065 Fixed - Increasing the limit for "max_request_size" in log configuration from 2k to 10k. The default will change from "any" to 2k to maintain the old behaviour.
- 9297 Fixed - Add new limit from `responseCheckLength` to response ingress event handling in order to reduce the memory used for buffering.

### Limitation

- 9992 - There is a limitation on Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) protocol on CentOS 7 as the Enforcer does not support this protocol on this Operating System (OS). When a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed with EdDSA is used on CentOS 7, it results in a `VIOL_ACCESS_INVALID` error.

### **Important Notes**

- Starting with this release, the bot signatures list is generated automatically as a part of the **app-protect-bot-signatures** package, which is a dependency of the **app-protect-compiler** package. It resembles a format similar to the README-style text file found in the attack signature.
Refer to the [Bot Signatures Update File]({{< ref "/waf/policies/bot-signatures.md" >}}) for more details.

- Starting with the next release version of F5 WAF for NGINX, the existing bot signatures file `included_bot_signatures` which is located at the following path: `/opt/app-protect/var/update_files/included_bot_signatures` will be removed from the **app-protect-compile** package.

##### Ubuntu 22.04

### Resolved Issues

- 8264 Fixed - Implemented the capability to turn enforcer debug logs on/off without the need for a system reload to apply the changes.
- 9060 Fixed - Default uri size is changed from 2k to 8k so that the user can send bigger uri without any configuration change. Now the user will be able to control the size by using policy configuration.
- 9185 Fixed - Unparsable requests, rejected by NGINX are now flagged with `SECURITY_WAF_VIOLATION` instead of `SECURITY_WAF_VIOLATION_TRANSPARENT`.

### **Important Notes**

- Starting with this release, the `app_protect_compressed_requests_action` directive has been deprecated from the nginx configuration. Now by default the enforcer will decompress all the HTTP compressed payload request and will apply the enforcement. 

- The F5 WAF for NGINX has been enhanced to include response signature checks within the "filetypes" section. You have an option to enable the signature verification in the response by setting the `responseCheck` parameter to true. By default, this parameter is set to false. See [Restrict Response Signatures]({{< ref "/waf/policies/response-signatures.md" >}}) for more details.
