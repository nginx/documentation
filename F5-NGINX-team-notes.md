# For F5/NGINX Employees

This repository is public, and we do as much of our work as possible in the public as a commitment to open source.

Before new content is published at https://docs.nginx.com, it must be committed to this `documentation` repository. 

If you are an F5 employee unable to assign yourself as an owner of an issue or a reviewer of a pull request, ask a member of the NGINX documentation team for help.

If your content cannot be publicized before release, it is handled differently: read the [Contributing guidelines for closed content](/CLOSED_CONTRIBUTIONS.md) document.

We encourage you to work with community contributors. If you participate in PRs, issues, discussions, and more, follow these guidelines:

- Follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Be helpful. We want to encourage people who contribute to continue.
  - If you need to say "no," here's [an example](https://github.com/nginx/documentation/pull/307#issuecomment-2748521932) of how we interact with the community.
- Avoid references and links to internal content. 
- Do not include information about future releases, changes, or features, unless
  specifically authorized.
- Do not include anything that even resembles PII.
- Do not include information that is proprietary to and/or private within F5/NGINX.

As an F5/NGINX employee, if you have a GitHub account, you should be able to clone these repositories.

To protect F5/NGINX, the ability to merge pull requests is strictly limited to employees of F5/NGINX.
