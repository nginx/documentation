# For F5/NGINX Employees

This repository is a functional mirror. We want to do as much of our work as possible in the
public repository. However, if you are working with:

- Security content, including personally identifying information (PII).
- Content / features that are not yet ready to be announced.

Before new content is published at https://docs.nginx.com, it must be written to this `documentation` repository. After you get approvals in the internal `docs` repository, you'll need to create a _second_ pull request in this open `documentation` repository.

If you are unable to assign yourself as an owner of an issue or a reviewer of a pull request, and are an employee of F5, ask a member of the NGINX documentation team for help.

We encourage you to work with community contributors. If you participate in
PRs, issues, discussions, and more, follow these guidelines:

- Follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Be helpful. We want to encourage people who contribute to continue.
  - If you need to say "no," here's [an example](https://github.com/nginx/documentation/pull/307#issuecomment-2748521932) of how we interact with the community.
- Avoid references and links to internal content. 
- Do not include information about future releases, changes, or features, unless
  specifically authorized.
- Do not include anything that even resembles PII.
- Do not include information that is proprietary to and/or private within F5/NGINX.

As an F5/NGINX employee, if you have a GitHub account, you should be able to clone these repositories.

To protect F5/NGINX, the ability to merge pull requests is strictly limited to employees of F5/NGINX.
