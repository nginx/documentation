# For F5/NGINX Employees

This repository is a functional mirror. We want to do as much of our work as possible in the
public repository. However, if you are working with:

- Security content, including personally identifying information (PII).
- Content / features that are not yet ready to be announced.

Make changes to the `docs-internal` repository. When you create a branch, start it with:
`internal/`. 

- The public `docs` repository will reject branches that start with `internal/`.
- The `docs-internal` repository will accept branches _only_ if it includes `internal/`.

If you need to review a pull request and are an employee of F5/NGINX, ask a member of @nginx/nginx-docs for help.

We encourage you to work with community contributors. If you participate in
PRs, issues, discussions, and more, follow these guidelines:

- Follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Be helpful. We want to encourage people who contribute to continue.
- Avoid references and links to internal content. 
- Do not include information about future releases, changes, or features, unless
  specifically authorized.
- Do not include anything that even resembles PII.
- Do not include information that is proprietary to and/or private within F5/NGINX.

To protect F5/NGINX, the ability to merge pull requests is strictly limited to employees of F5/NGINX.
