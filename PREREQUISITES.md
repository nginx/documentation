## Prerequisites

In general, you can install F5 NGINX on any modern major Linux/UNIX distribution, on-premises or in the "cloud." However, support is limited to the distributions shown in the prerequisites for each product, as linked from this page.

Most NGINX projects include technical specifications, as well as compatibility tables for integrating various parts of NGINX software.

In many cases, you can also install NGINX in Docker containers, or with the help of Kubernetes.

This page includes links prerequisites or technical specifications for each project:
