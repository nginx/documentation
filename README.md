# NGINX documentation

This repository contains the user documentation for NGINX's products, as well as the requirements to build and publish the documentation website.

Documentation is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), then transformed into HTML using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.
