## Get Started

You can find F5 NGINX documentation at https://docs.nginx.com. These documents describe how to install and configure both open source and commercial projects.

If you want to try one of our commercial products, you can:

- Get a [trial license](https://www.f5.com/trials)
  - Use the procedures in our [NGINX Solutions](https://docs.nginx.com/solutions/) site to download, install, and activate the product of your choice.

The same procedures apply whether you have a paid or a trial subscription.
<!-- Ideal world, I'd include links to "Get started" or "Install" procedures for each product/module. -->
