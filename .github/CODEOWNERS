# Each of these groups of CODEOWNERS have approval and merge authority over 
# the noted directories.
#
# If you want to add, modify, or delete files in any of these directories,
# open a pull request. Then add the appropriate group name (without the `@`)
# to the list of "Reviewers."
#
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes precedence. 
# For example, when someone opens a pull request that only modifies files 
# in the content/nginx-one directory, you should assign @nginxinc/one-docs-approvers
# as a reviewer.
# 
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
