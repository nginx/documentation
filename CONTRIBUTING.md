# Contributing guidelines

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. We really appreciate your desire to contribute!

## F5 Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

F5 requires all external contributors to agree to the terms of the F5 CLA (available [here](https://github.com/f5/.github/blob/main/CLA/cla-markdown.md)) before any of their changes can be incorporated into an F5 Open Source repository.

If you have not yet agreed to the F5 CLA terms and submit a PR to this repository, a bot will prompt you to view and agree to the F5 CLA. You will have to agree to the F5 CLA terms through a comment in the PR before any of your changes can be merged. Your agreement signature will be safely stored by F5 and no longer be required in future Pull or Merge Requests.

## Options to get started

<!-- Separate doc pages, CONTRIBUTING_GIT.md and CONTRIBUTING_other.md. 
Need: issue to include "Edit this page" links, similar to what we already do for N Unit docs, https://unit.nginx.org/ -->

At this time, we support contributions using Git. We expect this audience to also know how to build documentation using the command line. If you're in this group, start with how you can [contribute with Git](./CONTRIBUTING_GIT.md).
<!-- People who contribute via CloudCannon? 

We're working on alternative contribution methods, described in CONTRIBUTING_OTHER.md
-->

Alternatively, you're welcome to highight problems with our documentation as
described in our [support](./SUPPORT.md) page.
