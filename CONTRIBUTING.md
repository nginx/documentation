## Open a Discussion

we encourage you to use
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nginx/documentation/discussions).

## Submit a Pull Request

To contribute to F5 NGINX documentation, follow these steps:

- Fork the NGINX repository
- Create a branch
- Implement your changes in your branch
- Submit a pull request (PR) when your changes are ready for review

Alternatively, you're welcome to suggest improvements to highlight problems with
our documentation as described in our [support](./SUPPORT.md) page.

### Git style guide

- Keep a clean, concise and meaningful Git commit history on your branch, rebasing locally and squashing before you submit a PR
- Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>
  and summarized in the next few points:

  - In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
  - In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
  - Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less
  - Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
  - Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in
    your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)

#### Branch protection rules

This repository has the following branch protection rules in place:

- **Pushing branches that contain the "internal/" prefix is not allowed.** This ensures internal development branches are not accidentally or purposefully pushed to this repo.
- **Two approvers are required for all merges to main and release branches.** This ensures all code that is approved for release to production is appropriately reviewed. This rule applies to all branches with `*release*` in the branch name.
- **Only NGINX DocOps Team members can create release branches.** This ensures the docs team is aware of all branches supporting specific product releases. This rule applies to all branches with `*release*` in the branch name.
- **Pushes (force or otherwise) directly to main or release branches is not allowed.** Release branches serve as "main" for the release they are associated with. Restricting pushes directly to main and release branches ensures all content changes are reviewed and approved. This rule applies to all branches with `*release*` in the branch name and to "main".

### Documentation style guide

For detailed guidance, see our documentation [style guide](./templates/style-guide.md).

## Issue lifecycle

To ensure a balance between work carried out by the NGINX team while encouraging community involvement on this project, we use the following
issue lifecycle:

- A new issue is created by a community member
- An owner on the NGINX team is assigned to the issue; this owner shepherds the issue through the subsequent stages in the issue lifecycle
- The owner assigns one or more [labels](https://github.com/nginxinc/oss-docs/issues/labels) to the issue
- The owner, in collaboration with the community member, determines what milestone to attach to an issue. They may be milestones correspond to product releases
