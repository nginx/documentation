## Open a Discussion

If you want to start a conversation with the community and maintainers,
we encourage you to use
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nginxinc/oss-docs/discussions).

## Submit a Pull Request

To contribute to NGINX documentation, follow these steps:

- Fork the NGINX repository
- Create a branch
- Implement your changes in your branch
- Submit a pull request (PR) when your changes are ready for review

## Contributing with Git

<!-- Separate doc pages, CONTRIBUTING_GIT.md and CONTRIBUTING_other.md. 
Need: issue to include "Edit this page" links, similar to what we already do for N Unit docs, https://unit.nginx.org/ -->

At this time, we support contributions using Git. We expect this audience to also know how to build documentation using the command line. If you're in this group, start with how you can [contribute with Git](./CONTRIBUTING_GIT.md).
<!-- People who contribute via CloudCannon? 

We're working on alternative contribution methods, described in CONTRIBUTING_OTHER.md
-->

Alternatively, you're welcome to highlight problems with our documentation as
described in our [support](./SUPPORT.md) page.

## Issue Lifecycle

To ensure a balance between work carried out by the NGINX team while encouraging community involvement on this project, we use the following
issue lifecycle:

- A new issue is created by a community member
- An owner on the NGINX team is assigned to the issue; this owner shepherds the issue through the subsequent stages in the issue lifecycle
- The owner assigns one or more [labels](https://github.com/nginxinc/oss-docs/issues/labels) to the issue
- The owner, in collaboration with the wider team, determines what milestone to attach to an issue. They may be milestones correspond to product releases

## F5 Contributor License Agreement

F5 requires all external contributors to agree to the terms of the [F5 CLA](./CLA/cla-markdown.md), before any of their changes can be incorporated into an F5 Open Source repository.

If you have not yet agreed to the F5 CLA terms and submit a PR to this repository, a bot will prompt you to view and agree to the F5 CLA. You will have to agree to the F5 CLA terms through a comment in the PR before any of your changes can be merged. Your agreement signature will be safely stored by F5 and no longer be required in future Pull or Merge Requests.
