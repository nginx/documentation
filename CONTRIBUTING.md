we encourage you to use
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nginxinc/oss-docs/discussions).

## Submit a Pull Request

To contribute to NGINX documentation, follow these steps:

- Fork the NGINX repository
- Create a branch
- Implement your changes in your branch
- Submit a pull request (PR) when your changes are ready for review

Alternatively, you're welcome to suggest improvements to highlight problems with
our documentation as described in our [support](./SUPPORT.md) page.

### Git Style Guide

- Keep a clean, concise and meaningful Git commit history on your branch, rebasing locally and squashing before you submit a PR
- Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>
  and summarized in the next few points:

  - In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
  - In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
  - Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less
  - Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
  - Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in
    your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)

### Docuemntation style guide

For detailed guidance, see our documentation [style guide](./templates/style-guide.md).

## Issue lifecycle

To ensure a balance between work carried out by the NGINX team while encouraging community involvement on this project, we use the following
issue lifecycle:

- A new issue is created by a community member
- An owner on the NGINX team is assigned to the issue; this owner shepherds the issue through the subsequent stages in the issue lifecycle
- The owner assigns one or more [labels](https://github.com/nginxinc/oss-docs/issues/labels) to the issue
- The owner, in collaboration with the community member, determines what milestone to attach to an issue. They may be milestones correspond to product releases
