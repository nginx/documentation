# Git conventions

- Keep a clean, concise and meaningful Git commit history on your branch, rebasing locally and squashing before you submit a PR
- We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) formatting.
- Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>
  and summarized in the next few points:

  - In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
  - In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
  - Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less
  - Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
  - Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in
    your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)
