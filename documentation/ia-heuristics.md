# Information architecture heuristics

This document describes some of the heuristics that the NGINX DocOps team uses to examine information architecture.

It is intended as reference information for discussions and work management artefacts (Such as reports or issues).

These heuristics are an adaptation of work done by [Abby Covert](https://abbycovert.com/).

| [Learnable](#learnable)         | Is navigating information familiar to the user?         |
| [Useful](#useful)               | Does the information lead to the intended result?       |
| [Valuable](#valuable)           | Is the information provided valuable, and how?          |

## Accessible

- Is the information accessible through the most common mediums and devices?
- How does the information behave when perceived through other means?
- Does the information match or exceed any compliance guidelines?

_Accessible_ concerns how navigable the information is by users. A user should be able to traverse content using any input method, browser or device desired.

If critical details are not available to a user based on the method they use to access information, it is not accessible.

## Clear

- Is the information easy to understand and explain?
- How does the structure reduce noise for the user journey?
- Does the structure fulfil the expectations of the user persona?

_Clear_ concerns whether or not the information aligns with the user's background and if it is devoid of distractions.

The structure should streamline the user experience for navigating and reading information, allowing them to understand intent without ambiguity.

## Communicative

- Is the structure effective in recognising the user's state?
- Are the structure and information consistent?
- How does the structure support the information being shared?

_Communicative_ concerns the effectiveness of the user journey.

A user should be able to make informed decisions about their actions in a timely manner, and able to orient themselves within the structure.

## Controllable

- Is the process state clear for a task from the information?
- Can the user anticipate errors or mistakes?
- Are important controls clearly marked?

_Controllable_ concerns where information leads a user and how that affects them. They should be aware of the consequences when following instructions.

If a document leaves a user in an inoperable state, it is not controllable. This could be caused by incomplete information, or information split across multiple places reliant on context to finish a task.

## Credible

- Is the tone and focus of the information consistent?
- Can the user trust the accuracy of the information?
- When and how is information updated?

_Credible_ concerns trust in the information provided. If the tone or presentation of information is unclear, it may build uncertainty for a user.

The credibility of information can be considered based on where it exists in overall structure, and indicators of how recently it was updated.

## Delightful

- Does the structure make a task feel easy?
- Is supporting information provided where useful?
- How does the information exceed expectation?

_Delightful_ is the step beyond fulfilling basic expectations.

This concerns overall quality of the user experience, such as smooth transitions between mediums and useful recommendations.

## Findable

- Is it easy for users to locate information?
- What methods are available for users to discover information?
- Does the information translate effectively for non-human users?

_Findable_ concerns how a user discovers and traverses your collection of information.

This can reflect the navigation tree or sitemap of a website, as well as contextual links between information. It is also related to how the information is percieved through search mechanisms.

## Learnable

- Is the structure clear and easy to understand?
- Is the structure memorable?
- How does the structure help someone understand the information?

_Learnable_ concerns whether or not the structure makes sense to a user, and how it shapes their mental model of information.

This can be examined from multiple angles, such as if the structure is consistent across products, or if it matches their journey.

## Useful

- Is the information correct?
- Is the information complete?
- Does the information serve both existing and new users?

_Useful_ concerns the baseline for the user experience by enabling them to complete tasks.

Information is useful if it accomodates new and old users, and if it enables them to concisely navigate through context with confidence.

## Valuable

- Is the information desireable to the user?
- Does it fulfill expectations across all channels?
- How is success quantified?

_Valuable_ concerns if the information is desireable, and if the story presented compelling to the user.

This can be emphasized by highlighting information that aligns with the user's mental models and the tangible benefits of a particular use case.
