# Information architecture heuristics

This document describes some of the heuristics that the NGINX DocOps team uses to examine information architecture.

Is is intended as reference information for discussions and work management artefacts (Such as reports or issues).

These heuristics are an adaptation of work done by [Abby Covert](https://abbycovert.com/).

## Accessible

- Is the information accessible through the most common mediums and devices?
- How does the information behave when perceived through other means?
- Does the information match or exceed any compliance guidelines?

## Clear

- Is the information easy to understand and explain?
- How does the structure reduce noise for the user journey?
- Does the structure fulfil the expectations of the user persona?

## Communicative

- Is the structure effective in recognising the user's state?
- Are the structure and information consistent?
- How does the structure support the information being shared?

## Controllable

- Is the process state clear for a task from the information?
- Can the user anticipate errors or mistakes?
- Are important controls clearly marked?

## Credible

- Is the tone and focus of the information consistent?
- Can the user trust the accuracy of the information?
- When and how is information updated?

## Delightful

- Does the structure make a task feel easy?
- Is supporting information provided where useful?
- How does the information exceed expectation?

## Findable

- Is it easy for users to locate information?
- What methods are available for users to discover information?
- Does the information translate effectively for non-human users?

## Learnable

- Is the structure clear and easy to understand?
- Is the structure memorable?
- How does the structure help someone understand the information?

## Useful

- Is the information correct?
- Is the information complete?
- Does the information serve both existing and new users?

## Valuable
